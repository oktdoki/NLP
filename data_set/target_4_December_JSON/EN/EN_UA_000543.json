    "text": "Ukraine Appeals for Calm, Says Russian Invasion Not Imminent \n\n A top Ukrainian official has appealed for calm as he reassured the nation that an invasion from neighboring Russia was not imminent\u2014despite officials acknowledging there is a real threat as NATO allies have ramped up defenses in the Baltic Sea region this week.\n\nOleksii Reznikov, Ukraine\u2019s Minister of Defense, said on Monday that at this time, \u201cthere are no grounds to believe\u201d that Moscow is preparing an invasion very soon and there is no need for citizens \u201cto have [their] bags packed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, sleep well,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthere are risky scenarios. They\u2019re possible and probable in the future,\u201d though at this time \u201csuch a threat doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also told the nation that the situation is \u201cunder control,\u201d while Reznikov affirmed Russia had not formed what he called battle groups, \u201cwhich would have indicated that tomorrow they could launch an offensive.\u201d\n\nReznikov\u2019s and Zelensky\u2019s statement in a bid to project calm in order not to destabilize the situation and avoid panic comes as another multi-million dollar shipment of U.S. military equipment arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOur partners are increasing the amount of military assistance. And today we are meeting the third aircraft from the United States government as part of this assistance,\u201d the defense minister said at a press briefing before the aircraft loaded with defensive aid totaling about $200 million landed at an airport in the capital of Ukraine.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly denied intentions to invade Ukraine, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying the West is showing \u201chysteria\u201d and is putting out information \u201claced with lies.\u201d\n\nPeskov on Tuesday again accused the U.S. of \u201cfomenting tensions\u201d around Ukraine, a former Soviet state that has been locked in a conflict with Russia for almost eight years.\n\nWestern concern over Moscow planning an invasion of its neighbor started after tens of thousands of Russian troops massed near the Russia\u2013Ukraine border. In 2014, Russia used its military forces to annex the Crimean Peninsula, a move that drew sanctions from then-President Barack Obama. The fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels has killed over 14,000 people, and efforts to reach a peaceful settlement have stalled.",
