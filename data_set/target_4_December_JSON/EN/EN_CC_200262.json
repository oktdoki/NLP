Do you have a climate plan?\u201d Varney asked.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018We Are Now Formally Back on Indictment Watch\u2019 With Trump Georgia Grand Jury: Former Federal Prosecutor\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be to rip up Joe Biden\u2019s Green New Deal,\u201d DeSantis bragged. \u201cI think at the end of the day, we need to embrace American domestic energy. This could be a huge source of national security, economic vitality can build our industrial base in Florida.\u201d\n\nDeSantis\u2019 claim echoes Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy\u2018s, who last Thursday said God has blessed America with large natural gas resources, and the United States should use them to make two of the world\u2019s largest countries and largest economies, China and India, \u201cdependent on American natural gas.\u201d He suggested doing so would \u201cmake us economically stronger but geopolitically the world safer,\u201d while falsely claiming it would make the world \u201cenvironmentally sound.\u201d\n\nThe Florida governor bragged to Varney about Florida\u2019s reduction in emissions, which happened, he admitted, through \u201cmarket forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve actually had a huge reduction in emissions but it was done through innovation,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cIt was done through market forces, not command and control. So we\u2019ll go about that in a much different direction than, than Joe Biden, I think ultimately, Biden\u2019s policies and Bidenomics is really about making the average person poor and reducing their standard of living. That is not the way you go about it.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018Keeps on Chugging\u2019: Unemployment Down and Wages Up in \u2018Strong\u2019 and Record-Setting June Jobs Report\n\nLast year, a Tampa Bay Times opinion piece noted, \u201c2018, the last year for which [emissions] data is available, Florida utilities had decreased emissions by 19%, the research shows, while tailpipe emissions grew 12%.\u201d\n\nDeSantis was sworn into office in 2019.\n\nAlso last year, the Miami Herald warned Florida was not addressing the causes of climate change.\n\n\u201cThe last time the Legislature addressed the root cause of climate change \u2014 greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 it was in a law that effectively blocked cities from cutting emissions,\u201d the paper reported.\n\nWatch DeSantis below or at this link.",
