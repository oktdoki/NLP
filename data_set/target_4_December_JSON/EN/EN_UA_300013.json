Such fundamental legal foundations of world economic relations as free competition and the immunity of property have been destroyed,\u201d the Russian diplomat noted.\n\nLavrov went on to assert that the American currency has long been used as a weapon, adding that \u201cdestructive actions\u201d by Western nations have resulted in producing the opposite effect to the intended one. The diplomat argued that US-led sanctions aimed at isolating Russia and crippling its economy in reality have stimulated the \u201cstrengthening of multipolarity in international affairs.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lavrov, there is a growing awareness in the world that \u201cno one is immune\u201d in the face of the \u201caggressive actions of Washington and Brussels.\u201d\n\nHe noted that not only Russia but many other countries are now \u201cconsistently\u201d reducing their dependence on Western currencies by switching to alternatives for foreign-trade settlements.\n\nThe global trend towards using national currencies in trade instead of the US dollar began to gain momentum last year after Ukraine-related sanctions saw Russia cut off from the Western financial system and also saw its foreign reserves frozen.\n\nAs multipolarity takes shape, more nations are working on creating new transport corridors and supply chains. Meanwhile, an \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cunbalanced\u201d model of globalization has become outdated, Lavrov said.",
