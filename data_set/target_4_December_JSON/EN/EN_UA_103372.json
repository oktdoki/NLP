    "text": "Putin Says US, NATO Ignored Its Security Demands as Kremlin Rules out War in Ukraine \n\n The president of Russia said on Friday the United States and its NATO allies have ignored Moscow\u2019s security demands, while a top Kremlin official said Russia does not want a war.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be a war as far as it depends on the Russian Federation, we don\u2019t want a war,\u201d Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during an interview with local radio stations. \u201cBut we won\u2019t let our interests be rudely trampled on and ignored.\u201d\n\nDuring the call, Putin said he wants to continue dialogue with the West to negotiate a stalled peace agreement for eastern Ukraine between Russia, Ukraine, France, and Germany. Presidential envoys from the four countries already met in Paris on Wednesday and agreed to another meeting in Berlin in two weeks.\n\nThe latest diplomatic move also comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday called on the West not to create \u201cpanic,\u201d challenging U.S. warnings about an imminent Russian attack.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t consider the situation now tenser than before. There is a feeling abroad that there is war here. That\u2019s not the case,\u201d Zelensky told reporters at a Friday press briefing. \u201cWe don\u2019t need this panic,\u201d he added.\n\nZelensky\u2019s comment comes one day after rumors spread that President Joe Biden warned him during a phone call that Kyiv would soon be \u201csacked\u201d in an invasion by Russian military forces.\n\n\u201cHe has previously said this publicly and we have been warning about this for months. Reports of anything more or different than that are completely false,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko also ruled out that there will be war, saying there will not be a war unless Belarus or Russia comes under attack.\n\n\u201cThe leaders of some countries have gone mad, they think they can win that war,\u201d Lukashenko said. \u201cBut there will be no victory, we will all lose.\u201d\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told parliament the number of Russian troops near Ukraine\u2014which amounts to about 130,000\u2014is comparable to Moscow\u2019s military buildup last spring, when Moscow eventually pulled its forces back after massive exercises.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t observed any events or actions of military character that significantly differ from what was going on last spring,\u201d with the exception of the deployment to Belarus, Reznikov said.\n\nWhile Moscow and the West are mulling their next steps, NATO said it was bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region, and the United States ordered 8,500 troops on higher alert for potential deployment to Europe.\n\nRussia has launched military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, and dozens of warships in the Black Sea and the Arctic. Russian troops have also headed to Belarus for sweeping joint drills, again raising Western fears that Moscow could stage an attack on Ukraine from the north.",
