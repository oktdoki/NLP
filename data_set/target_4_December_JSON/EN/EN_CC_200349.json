    "text": "Great Barrier Reef Doomsday Claims Should Be Audited: Scientist \n\n Australian geo-physicist Peter Ridd says an additional $5 million (US$3.3 million) allocated to the Great Barrier Reef in this week\u2019s budget would be better spent on \u201cgenuine environmental problems.\u201d\n\nThe funding was handed down as part of Labor\u2019s 2024 federal budget on May 14.\n\nIn a statement released last month, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation said the reef had suffered through the \u201cworst summer\u201d on record, with cyclones, severe flooding, starfish outbreaks and mass bleaching.\n\nThe funds will help the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to engage tourism operators undertaking reef monitoring, protection, and stewardship.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef Foundation says the full extent of mass bleaching is not known, but claims aerial surveys over 1,000 reefs showed a rate of 73 percent bleaching within the area, plus another 6 percent in the Torres Strait.\n\nReef Subject to Constant \u2018Doom-News\u2019: RiddYet Mr. Ridd, a researcher into the Reef, believes its poor health has been greatly exaggerated.\n\n\u201cIt is telling that in the latest doom-news about the Great Barrier Reef bleaching, they failed to mention that the Great Barrier Reef had record amounts of coral in 2022/23 despite having suffered four \u2018catastrophic\u2019 bleaching events in 2016, 17, 20, and 22,\u201d he told The Epoch Times in an email.\n\n\u201cWe ended up with twice as much coral than in 2012 when a couple of cyclones genuinely destroyed a lot of coral.\n\n\u201cHow did we end up with so much coral if those last four bleaching event were so catastrophic\u2014even the fast-growing coral takes five to 10 years to regrow.\u201d\n\nThe coral that bounced back, he says, is the type most susceptible to water bleaching.\n\n\u201cThat proves the last four bleaching events were exaggerated in terms of the coral death, and there is no reason to expect this latest event to be much different,\u201d he said.\n\nMinister Says Jobs and Reef Depend on FundingFederal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek announced earlier this month that the government would also fund $17.48 million in local council projects to protect the Reef.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to protecting our precious Great Barrier Reef and supporting the 64,000 jobs that depend on it,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\n\u201cProtecting and restoring the Great Barrier Reef requires all levels of government and communities to work together.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Ridd says there\u2019s evidence the Reef is thriving.\n\n\u201cThe latest $5 million in the budget is just a drop in a bucket of how much cash is wasted \u2019saving' the Great Barrier Reef, which is actually one of the most pristine ecosystems on the planet,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI estimate about $400 million are spent each year\u2014and that is almost all wasted. We'd be better off spending it on genuine environmental problems.\u201d\n\nMr. Ridd said the money could be used to audit the claims of widespread reef destruction.\n\n\u201cIn the Great Barrier Reef science institutions there is a great deal of groupthink, emotion, and raw self-interest to maintain the fiction that the Great Barrier Reef is in grave danger,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDissenters are excluded and removed. The institutions need to be challenged by an official scientific \u2019red-team.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe cash could also be well spent on a publicity campaign pointing out the good condition on the reef. The recurring bad news and exaggeration is very bad for the Great Barrier Reef tourist industry.\u201d\n\nThe March 2022\u201323 budget allocated a $1 billion funding package over nine years to help maintain the reef.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water said a wide range of funding had been put in place to protect and maintain the World Heritage listed site.\n\n\u201cThe Australian government has committed record funding of $1.2 billion in the Great Barrier Reef through to 2030, including an extra $5 million to extend the Tourism Reef Protection Initiative, so tourism operators on the Great Barrier Reef can continue to play a key role in protecting this precious area,\u201d a spokesperson told The Epoch Times.",
