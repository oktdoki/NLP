According to Fox Business, the Department of Energy has proposed new rules that would reduce the current limits for water and energy use in dishwashers.\n\nThe proposed rules would limit dishwashers to using 3.2 gallons of water per cycle, significantly lower than the current limit of 5 gallons, and manufacturers would need to reduce their products\u2019 energy consumption by almost 30 percent. Even though most dishwashers available on the market already meet or exceed the current federal standards, the proposed rules have left some questioning why the Biden administration is focusing on such regulations rather than other priorities.\n\n\u201cDishwashers are not the only appliances Biden\u2019s DOE has set its sights on, however, as the regulator is also considering crackdowns on washers, dryers and refrigerators that manufacturers say could reduce performance,\u201d Fox Business noted further.\n\nMembers of the regime have been clear: The rule changes pertain to Biden\u2019s \u2018climate agenda.\u2019\n\n\u201cCollectively these energy efficiency actions \u2026 support President Biden\u2019s ambitious clean energy agenda to combat the climate crisis,\u201d the DOE wrote earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThis Administration is using all of the tools at our disposal to save Americans money while promoting innovations that will reduce carbon pollution and combat the climate crisis,\u201d Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm stated in a Friday news release.\n\nCritics have also poked major holes in the regime's claim that the new rules are going to save American consumers oodles of money each year.\n\n\u201cThe department estimates that consumers will save $3 billion over the next 30 years, or $100 million per year, on their utility bills thanks to the rougher rules,\u201d Christian Britschgi wrote at Reason. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty small per capita savings when spread across the 89 million dishwasher-owning households.\u201d\n\nIn fact, he noted that the new rules actually might lead to more water use:\n\nThe new regulations might lead to more water usage as individuals switch to washing dishes by hand, Britschgi pointed out, citing research from the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI).\n\nThe think tank\u2019s proposal led President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to approve a new class of dishwashers that clean dishes in one hour, though Biden\u2019s team repealed the pro-consumer regulatory agenda of his predecessor.\n\nThe proposed dishwasher regulations follow a recent debate over gas stoves at the national level. Despite Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s reassurances that there is nothing to be concerned about, just last week his home state of New York prohibited gas stoves.\n\n\u201cNobody is taking away your gas stove,\u201d Schumer tweeted in early February. \u201cShameless and desperate MAGA Republicans are showing us they will cook up any distraction to divert from real issues the American people want solved, like the debt ceiling.\u201d\n\nThat turned out to be 100 percent false, obviously.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, New York lawmakers agreed to ban gas stove hookups in all future buildings in late April. The ban will affect new construction on small buildings in 2025 and move on to larger buildings by 2028,\u201d Fox Business added.\n\nIn a statement last month, Consumer Product Safety Commission Commissioner Richard Trumka Jr., a Democratic activist and labor union leader, suggested that stoves could pose a \u201chidden hazard\u201d to users and that \"any option is on the table.\" However, after receiving backlash, Chairman Alex Hoehn-Saric clarified that the agency had no plans to ban stoves.\n\nBut in February, the Energy Department went ahead with a new proposal that would allow government regulators to write energy consumption standards for the appliances, the Daily Wire reported.\n\nSources include:",
