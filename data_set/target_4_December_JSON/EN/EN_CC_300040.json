    "text": "California Governor Slams Big Oil For Lying About Climate Change \n\n US News & World Report's\u2026\n\nWhile predictions of a fully-fledged\u2026\n\nCalifornia\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, accused the oil industry of lying days after the state\u2019s Attorney General filed a lawsuit against five Big Oil majors for downplaying climate change risks.\n\n\u201cThe climate crisis is, after all, a fossil fuel crisis,\u201d Newsom said, as quoted by Bloomberg, at the opening of Climate Week in New York City. \u201cThey continue to play us for fools. I\u2019ve had enough and I\u2019m sick and tired of this.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Newsom\u2019s office posted on X \u201cBig Oil has been lying to us \u2013 covering up the fact that they\u2019ve long known how dangerous the fossil fuels they produce are for our planet. It has been decades of damage & deception. With @AGRobBonta , California is taking action to hold big polluters accountable.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cbig polluters\u201d referred to in the post include Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell, and ConocoPhillips, Reuters reported. The American Petroleum Institute is also among the defendants.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges these companies had caused Californians billions of dollars in damages and its authors plan to create what they call an abatement fund to use for coverage of future damages, the Reuters report also noted.\n\nOn Sunday, Newsom called the damage already done \u201cincalculable\u201d.\n\nThe state of California has been at the forefront of the energy transition, sporting the highest fuel prices in the nation and also the biggest EV market. California is also a major electricity importer from other states and an oil importer, too.\n\nEarlier this year, Governor Newsom signed a bill for the ban of internal combustion engine vehicles from 2035 in California, following in the footsteps of the European Union and the UK, both with their own ICE car bans in the works.\n\nIn comments on the lawsuit, Chevron said \u201cClimate change is a global problem that requires a coordinated international policy response, not piecemeal litigation for the benefit of lawyers and politicians.\u201d\n\n\u201cIts local courts have no constructive or constitutionally permissible role in crafting global energy policy,\u201d a company spokesman also said, as quoted by Bloomberg.\n\n",
