We have no tolerance for calls for genocide, ethnic cleansing, or any kind of discrimination, harassment, or violence towards Russians on our platform,\" Clegg added.\n\nMost read in Tech\n\nLast Friday, the Kremlin opened a court case against Meta in direct retaliation to the social media giant's violent speech policy.\n\n\"A criminal case has been initiated \u2026 in connection with illegal calls for murder and violence against citizens of the Russian Federation by employees of the American company Meta,\" Russia's Investigative Committee said, according to Reuters.\n\nThe Russian prosecutor general's office asked a court to designate Meta an \"extremist organization\" and ban it from operating in the country after the social media giant changed its hate speech rules on Friday, per the Wall Street Journal.\n\nRead More on The US Sun\n\nThe prosecutor's office added that Meta's actions not only constitute terrorist activity but also incite \"hatred and enmity\" towards Russian citizens.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, Russia also announced that it would block civilians' access to Facebook and since then the media platform has been heavily restricted.\n\nWe pay for your stories!\n\nDo you have a story for The US Sun team?\n\nEmail us at exclusive@the-sun.com or call 212 416 4552.\n\nLike us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/TheSunUS and follow us from our main Twitter account at @TheSunUS",
