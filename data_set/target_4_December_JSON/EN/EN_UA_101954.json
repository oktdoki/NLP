The details remain unclear, but it\u2019s widely thought that he was killed by a precision drone strike at his residence. The world is watching to see whether Iran and/or its Resistance Axis allies will respond, what form it could take if so, and whether that would escalate tensions to a wider war.\n\nHere are five takeaways thus far:\n\n1. Israel\u2019s Intelligence & Tactics Are Top-Notch\n\nIsrael somehow or another obtained accurate intelligence about Haniyeh\u2019s location despite it being top-secret and was then able to successfully assassinate him. Whatever air defenses (including electronic warfare ones) that Iran had deployed in its capital as part of the security measures to protect its high-profile guests failed to thwart this attack. This is a major embarrassment for the Islamic Republic and prompts speculation about whether it was due to utter incompetence or was partially an inside job.\n\n2. Iran Is Caught In A Dilemma Over How To Respond\n\nIt\u2019s unimaginable that Iran won\u2019t respond to its Israeli enemy assassinating a high-profile allied guest in Tehran during the new president\u2019s inauguration, but the dilemma is over the form that this response will take. Launching another drone and missile salvo against Israel like it did in the spring after the bombing of its consulate in Damascus is possible, though Israel could spin that as a failure if many of them are shot down like last time, the on-the-ground damage is minimal, and no high-profile targets are killed.\n\n3. Mutually Assured Destruction Hangs Heavy Over Everyone\u2019s Head\n\nThe response that Iran resorts to will be determined by its leadership\u2019s understanding of how far they can go without triggering the \u201cmutually assured destruction\u201d (MAD) scenario, which both Israel and the Resistance Axis fear and is why they\u2019ve thus far restrained themselves from waging all-out war. A repeat of spring\u2019s salvo could remain below that threshold, but Iran might also respond in a different way that\u2019s interpreted by Israel as an escalation, thus prompting its own escalation that could then lead to MAD.\n\n4. A Choreographed Response Might Therefore Be The Most \u201cRational\u201d\u2026\n\nDuma member Dmitry Belik, whose claim to fame was helping Sevastopol reunify with Russia when he briefly served as the region\u2019s acting head in spring 2014, described spring\u2019s salvo as a \u201cbeautiful theatrical production\u201d. If there\u2019s any truth to his innuendo that Iran choreographed its response with the US and/or Israel to Israel\u2019s bombing of its consulate in Syria, then it might also do the same after Haniyeh\u2019s assassination, which could help Iran \u201csave face\u201d while averting an escalation towards MAD.\n\n5. \u2026But There\u2019s No Guarantee That Iran\u2019s Allies Will \u201cStand Down\u201d\n\nHamas and Hezbollah are Iran\u2019s allies but operate independently of it despite their close ties. There\u2019s accordingly no guarantee that they\u2019ll \u201cstand down\u201d and not respond in their own way if Iran sends another salvo to Israel regardless of whether or not it\u2019s choreographed. After all, Hamas\u2019 political chief was just killed, while one of Hezbollah\u2019s top commanders was assassinated by Israel in Beirut the day prior. This makes the MAD risk even less manageable since those two might not share Iran\u2019s calculations.\n\nHaniyeh\u2019s assassination is a watershed event in the latest Israeli-Hamas War, which is now a regional Israeli-Iranian proxy war, since it greatly spikes the risk of everything spiraling into MAD.\n\nIran\u2019s response will be crucial in determining whether or not that happens, but so too will Hamas and Hezbollah\u2019s.\n\nThey\u2019ll either \u201cstand down\u201d as Iran responds regardless of whether or not it\u2019s choreographed, participate in a joint response that remains below the MAD threshold, or decide to cross that red line on their own.",
