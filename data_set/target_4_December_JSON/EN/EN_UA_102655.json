    "text": "BIOWARFARE ON AMERICANS: RFK Jr. says CIA was directly involved in funding COVID research for Wuhan lab \n\n by Ethan Huff, Natural News:\n\nThe reason why the Biden regime could not care less about even attempting to punish communist China for covering up the \u201clab leak\u201d that many believe occurred at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, allowing the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to escape, is because doing so would expose the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its bioweapons program.\n\nThese and other statements were made by 2024 presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a recent interview with Fox News\u2018 Jesse Watters. Kennedy suggested that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is also involved in funding the bioweapons programs from which COVID appears to have originated.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\n\u201cI think the CIA was involved certainly in this research,\u201d Kennedy told Watters and viewers. \u201cThey were funding it through USAID. And NIH, I think, in the end gave about $26 million in funding to the Wuhan lab. But USAID, which was functioning as the CIA surrogate, gave over $64 million. The Pentagon also gave a lot of money.\u201d\n\nKennedy would go on in the interview to blast Tony Fauci, the former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), for his complicity in unleashing hell on the world that resulted in tens of millions of needless deaths.\n\n\u201cI think he caused a lot of injury,\u201d Kennedy, who wrote an entire book about the subject, said of Fauci. \u201cI think that he particularly, by withholding early treatment from Americans, we racked up the highest death count in the world. We only have 4.2 percent of the globe\u2019s population but we had 16 percent of the COVID deaths in this country and that was from bad policy.\u201d\n\nRFK Jr. says vaccines do, in fact, cause autism\n\nUnlike the United States, many other countries allowed their citizens to access tried-and-true remedies for coronaviruses such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), both of which were maligned or even banned in the U.S. as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were countries that did the opposite of what we did that provided ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, other early treatments to their population, and had 1/200th of our death rate,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nConcerning the subject of vaccines, Kennedy clarified for Watters and viewers his longtime position that poison jabs do, in fact, cause autism \u2013 though that does not necessarily mean that he opposes vaccines being legal, just so long as sound science is able to back them.\n\n\u201cI do believe that autism comes from vaccines,\u201d Kennedy revealed. \u201cBut I think most of the things people believe about my opinions about vaccines are wrong. I, you know, all I have said about vaccines is we should have good science.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should have the same kind of testing, placebo-controlled trials that we have for every other medication. Vaccines are exempt from pre-licensing placebo-controlled trials. There\u2019s no way that anybody can tell the risk profile of those products or even the relative benefits of those products before they\u2019re mandated, and we should have that kind of testing.\u201d\n\nBe sure to watch the interview with Kennedy below:\n\nOne commenter noted that he agrees with Kennedy in that COVID was \u201ccultivated\u201d and \u201cintentionally released at just the right time, one year before a U.S. presidential election.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was perfect timing for Biden\u2019s campaign to use it against Trump while they were working hard in the background to hide all of Biden\u2019s corruption,\u201d this person added. \u201cI think they are also funding labs in Ukraine as well. That and NATO membership is one of the biggest reasons Russia invaded.\u201d",
