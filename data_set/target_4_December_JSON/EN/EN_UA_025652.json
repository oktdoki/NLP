Not so long ago, we completed the formation of our segment of the International Monitoring System. We are ready to return to the issue of its ratification as soon as the US does this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Russian foreign minister also accused the Western countries of \u201ctailoring\u201d the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to their interests.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that to prevent further degradation of the world situation, maintain durable stability and create realistic disarmament, all countries should pool their efforts to upgrade the international security system relying on the principles of multilateralism, equality and indivisibility. This is the only way of reducing interstate conflicts and ensuring real progress in arms control,\u201d he said.",
