    "text": "Biden WH \u2018Amplifies\u2019 Climate Extremist Group \u2018Making Life Miserable\u2019 For Cabinet And Govt Officials \n\n The Biden administration celebrated praise from a far-left climate alarmist group known for harassing public officials and blocking roads on Saturday.\n\nFollowing its Friday announcement that it\u2019s pulling the plug on several liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in the name of so-called \u201cclimate change,\u201d the White House released a \u201cWHAT THEY ARE SAYING\u201d press release the following day that included remarks from left-wing climate activists and organizations celebrating the administration\u2019s continued war on efficient sources of energy and the American consumer. [emphasis, links added]\n\nAmong the groups propped up by the administration is Climate Defiance, a radical environmentalist group comprised of young Marxists who regularly disrupt traffic and shout down U.S. politicians to coerce them into advancing their radical agenda.\n\nAccording to InfluenceWatch, much of the organization\u2019s funding comes from the Climate Emergency Fund (CEF), a nonprofit \u201cthat channels money to groups engaged in climate activism.\u201d\n\nCEF has previously received funding from \u201cformer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s Onward Together, liberal activist Abigail Disney, and oil heiress Aileen Getty\u2019s Aileen Getty Foundation.\u201d\n\nIn its Saturday release, the White House specifically highlighted Climate Defiance\u2019s Jan. 26 tweet celebrating the administration\u2019s \u201cmonumental\u201d decision to ax the aforementioned LNG projects.\n\n\u201cNever thought we would see the day. The White House is amplifying our Twitter account. Words fail. Words fail. Words utterly fail,\u201d Climate Defiance\u2019s X account posted on Sunday.\n\nNever thought we would see the day.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., while he was speaking at a New Hampshire diner.\n\nClimate Defiance agitators chanted \u201canti-fossil fuels slogans\u201d during Manchin\u2019s remarks. One of them, carrying a sign \u201ccalling for the end of fossil fuel dependence,\u201d reportedly jumped in front of the senator\u2019s SUV as it was departing the venue.\n\nThe group claimed Manchin uses his position as chair of the Senate Energy Committee to \u201cprotect his personal coal company.\u201d\n\nClimate Defiance\u2019s radical behavior doesn\u2019t stop there.\n\nSince its 2023 launch, the group has attempted to corner several high-ranking Democrats, including President Joe Biden.\n\nAccording to InfluenceWatch, on April 29, its members \u201ccreated a blockade to prevent elected officials from attending the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner at the Washington Hilton, hoping to see [the president] and demand an end to leasing public lands for fossil fuel projects.\u201d\n\nThe organization\u2019s members harassed Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., at a book launch event in May and \u201cblocked traffic and protested outside\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s New York City residence later that same month.\n\nClimate Defiance demonstrators were also reportedly removed from a June event hosted by the Detroit Free Press, at which Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm was scheduled to speak.\n\nAmong the phrases shouted by agitators were, \u201cNo MVP. No LNG. Granholm, you are killing me,\u201d and, \u201cF-ck you, Jennifer. F-ck you, Joe Biden. F-ck all these politicians.\u201d\n\n",
