Foreign Secretary Liz Truss asserted, however, that Moscow must deescalate tensions and \u201cend its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy.\u201d\n\nBut over the weekend, Russian officials said the UK\u2019s Foreign Office should stop publishing \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201cdisinformation.\u201d\n\nThe embassy further alleged that the UK\u2019s strategy is to accuse \u201cRussia of plotting \u2018inevitable\u2019 invasion of Ukraine and try to play the role of an ideological leader, defending itself from \u2018autocrats\u2019 and aiming to \u2018free the world.\u2019\u201d\n\nMurayev, meanwhile, responded to the UK\u2019s statement by dismissing the claim.\n\nIn a message to Reuters, Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian adviser to the presidential office, said the allegations should be taken seriously, acknowledged there was doubt among Ukrainians as to whether Murayev was \u201ctoo ridiculous a figure\u201d to be the Kremlin\u2019s pick to lead Ukraine. But he added that Russia had propped up previously minor figures in leadership positions in annexed Crimea and separatist-held Donbass.\n\nTherefore \u201cone should take this information as seriously as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Saturday, U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne appeared to endorse the UK assessment that the Kremlin is plotting to install a Moscow-friendly puppet administration.\n\n\u201cThis kind of plotting is deeply concerning,\u201d Horne said. \u201cThe Ukrainian people have the sovereign right to determine their own future, and we stand with our democratically-elected partners in Ukraine.\u201d",
