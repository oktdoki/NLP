Namely, the much-hated carbon tax spiked yet again. These vile virtue-signalers are hellbent on \u201csaving the planet\u201d while they force more Canadians into bankruptcy.\n\nNot that Liberal members of Parliament are fretting over this fiscal kick to the crotch, mind you. Because on that very same day the carbon tax increased, MPs benefited from a 4% pay raise. Must be nice. But if this is some sort of April Fools\u2019 Day joke, we\u2019re still searching for the punchline.\n\nProtests regarding the carbon tax increase erupted across our great dominion last Monday, including one in Uxbridge, Ont., where dozens of farmers assembled outside an arena. Can you blame them? The Grain Farmers of Ontario (GFO) estimate that by 2030, Ontario grain and oilseed farmers alone will pay a staggering $2.7 billion in carbon taxes.\n\nRebel News journalist David Menzies (@TheMenzoid) reports from Uxbridge, Ont. as farmers take to the streets in opposition to the Trudeau Liberals' carbon tax increase.\u2014 Rebel News (@RebelNewsOnline) April 4, 2024\n\nOne of the farmers demonstrating in Uxbridge was Ted Eng, 71. He lamented that too many farmers are in a money-losing position now thanks to rising costs and labour rates. And increasing the tax threshold is akin to tossing gasoline on a bonfire.\n\nTed noted that if he were to sell his farm today, it would likely go for about $4 million. He\u2019d be able to pocket the windfall and comfortably retire. But he doesn\u2019t want to. He loves the land. He loves farming. He believes he\u2019s going to die on his farm.\n\nCanadians should be grateful that there are farmers like Ted Eng. Their efforts produce the food that ends up in supermarkets. If farmers are taxed out of existence, then goodbye food security as our meat and potatoes would have to be imported from other nations that have governments that are more farm friendly.\n\nCheck out our interview with Ted Eng, who has much to say about the sorry state of farming these days\u2026 not that the Trudeau Liberals give a rodent\u2019s rectum.\n\n",
