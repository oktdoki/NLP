    "text": "Russia Turns Missiles on Ukraine's Farm Storage \n\n Russian cruise missiles, flying low and hugging the terrain to dodge Ukrainian air defenses, destroyed farm storage buildings in the Odesa region early Friday, Ukrainian officials said, as the Kremlin\u2019s forces expanded their targets following three days of bombardment of the region\u2019s Black Sea port infrastructure.\n\nTwo missiles struck the storage facility, starting a fire, and while workers fought to put it out another missile hit, destroying farm and firefighting equipment, the southern Odesa region\u2019s Gov. Oleh Kiper said.\n\nThe attack injured two people and destroyed 100 metric tons of peas and 20 metric tons of barley, according to Kiper.\n\nThe attack was small-scale in comparison with barrages in recent days that put Odesa in Russia\u2019s crosshairs after Moscow tore up a wartime deal that allowed Ukraine to send grain through the key Black Sea port.\n\nRussia targeted Ukrainian critical grain export infrastructure after vowing to retaliate for an attack that damaged a crucial bridge between Russia and the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula.\n\nThough Friday\u2019s strike was more muted, the recent uptick in attacks has kept people in Odesa on edge.\n\n\u201cThe enemy is continuing terror, and it\u2019s undoubtedly related to the grain deal,\u201d said Natalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian military\u2019s Operational Command South.\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine have announced that they will treat ships traveling to each other\u2019s Black Sea ports as potential military targets.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said the recent barrages in southern Ukraine are part of an overarching strategy.\n\n\u201cThe Russian military\u2019s intensifying strikes against Ukrainian port and grain infrastructure and threats of maritime escalation are likely a part of a Kremlin effort to leverage Russia\u2019s exit from the Black Sea Grain Initiative and exact extensive concessions from the West,\u201d it said in an assessment late Thursday.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said the navy conducted drills that simulated action to seal off a section of the Black Sea.\n\nIn the maneuvers, a missile boat fired anti-ship cruise missiles at a mock target in the northwestern part of the Black Sea.\n\nIn other developments, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced the resignation of the country\u2019s Culture Minister, suggesting the ministry\u2019s spending was misguided during wartime.\n\n\u201cPaving stones, city decorations, and fountains can wait till after the victory,\u201d he said.\n\nThe move follows a series of recent scandals related to the expenditure of local authorities across the country, such as the repair of a cobblestone road in Kyiv\u2019s city center or a renovation of a city fountain in a western Ukraine city.\n",
