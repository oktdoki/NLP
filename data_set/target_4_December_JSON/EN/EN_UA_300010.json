Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) sent shockwaves through D.C. this week after she vowed to issue subpoenas to Hunter Biden\u2019s child sex victims, so that they can testify in front of Congress.\n\nAccording to comments from Rep. Greene, there are now discussions underway to bring in some of the Hunter\u2019s victims to testify in front of the House Oversight Committee:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to track down these women and talk to them and if there is a credible reason that we need to bring them in front of the Oversight Committee then absolutely we will do that. Especially when it involves our national security,\u201d Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) told the NY Post.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been talking about it with [committee] Chairman [James] Comer and we\u2019re already working in that direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was an entire stack of papers and it was each transaction, each person, each LLC, Hunter Biden\u2019s law firm, Hunter Biden himself, and multiple Biden family members \u2014 then it was all these prostitutes. And you can go through and it gives all the prostitutes\u2019 names, addresses, birthdates, telephone numbers, their passports,\u201d Greene added.\n\n\u201cWe need to talk to them, especially the ones from Russia and Ukraine. \u2026 We need to find out where they were with Hunter Biden. Did they go in the White House when [Joe Biden] was Vice President? We just need to know these things. Where they\u2019ve been, what they know, what they\u2019ve seen, what they\u2019ve heard.\u201d",
