The Pentagon is hoping the General Dynamics facility in Mesquite, Texas, will help satiate this ammo craving.\n\nAmerican factories in Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, together produce about 36,000 155mm shells per month.

The target goal is to churn out a monthly amount of 100,000 by the end of 2025.\n\nUkraine will not launch its own production of 155 mm caliber shells until the second half of 2024, The Washington Post has quoted sources as saying.— Sputnik (@SputnikInt) March 20, 2024\n\nAccording to a source, there is a catastrophic shortage of these shells on the front line, but production will not begin until \"the… pic.twitter.com/sRJ8D9a8CL\n\nThe United States and European countries have shipped tens of billions-worth of sophisticated military hardware to Ukraine, emptying their own armories of critical arms and ammunition stocks. None of the pricey hardware that taxpayers were fleeced over has helped Kiev, as the Zelensky regime racks up huge manpower losses in the face of consistent gains by Russia’s military.
