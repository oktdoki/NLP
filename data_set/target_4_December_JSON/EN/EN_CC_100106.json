Only the global elites will continue to live in their mansions, eat meat, and fly in private jets.\n\nAl Gore made the new Global Warming prediction from Davos as he sat outside in the freezing cold weather with a snowy backdrop.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that once we get to true net zero and stop adding, the temperatures will stop going up almost immediately, with a lag of as little as three years,\u201d Al Gore said without providing any evidence whatsoever to back up his new timeline.\n\nGore continued, \u201cAnd if we stay at true net zero half of the human cause to greenhouse gas pollution will fall out of the atmosphere in as little as 25 to 30 years, but getting there is very tough.\u201d\n\nWATCH:\n\nWeather prognosticator @algore: \u201cThe good news is that once we get to true net zero and stop adding, the temperatures will stop going up almost immediately, with a lag of as little as three years.\u201d pic.twitter.com/4dlCEzGMwx\n\n\u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) January 15, 2024\n\nOn December 13, 2008, junk scientist Al Gore predicted the North Polar Ice Cap would be completely ice-free in five years.\n\nAnd, with this lie, the global warming hysteria began.\n\nGore made the prediction to a German audience on December 13, 2008. Al warned them that \u201cthe entire North \u2018polarized\u2019 cap will disappear in 5 years.\u201d The Gateway Pundit reported on this at the time.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only time Al Gore made his ice-free prediction. Gore had been predicting the dire scenario since 2007. That means that the North Pole should have melted completely over a decade ago by now.\n\nAl Gore also made the same prediction in 2009.\n\nAt least 8 Dire Predictions from Al Gore\u2019s movie never occurred \u2013 not even close.\n\nBut Al Gore is repeatedly given a platform to fearmonger and make one prediction after another.",
