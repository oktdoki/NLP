    "text": "Scotland proposing nationwide \u201c20-minute neighborhoods\u201d where citizens are limited how far they can travel from home in order to save Earth from global warming \n\n\nAre you ready for your government to tell you that you can only travel a 20-minute radius from home because it\u2019s part of saving the planet from global warming? Scotland\u2019s plan to implement \u201c20-minute neighborhoods\u201d nationwide is almost ready to launch, and have no doubts, it\u2019s just another fancy name for climate lockdowns. No, this is not about the pandemic. This is about the governments of the world attempting to steal more freedoms and rights from their citizens, and if you believe you can save the world by staying near your home and neighborhood, then you most definitely are completely brainwashed by the crooked \u201csystem.\u201d\n\n\nThe fake \u201cwar on carbon\u201d includes restrictive 20-minute \u201cneighborhoods\u201d monitored by the tyrannical Scottish government and the United Nations\n\nIt\u2019s documented already. The Scottish government is prepared for climate lockdowns, where their citizens may never leave their homes again, except to visit the city park (think prison \u2018yard\u2019) or the nearby convenient store, then return immediately to house arrest. Every citizen will be treated like a hard criminal, and actually really become one, if the new mandates are broken.\n\nThis is all documented under the United Nations\u2019 \u201cSustainable Development Goals\u201d umbrella policy. That\u2019s because the \u201cClimate Emergency Response Group\u201d is on the scene, ready to save planet earth from the evil car users and restore the temperature back to whatever it was at before cars were invented (the same).\n\nGet ready to \u201cdecarbonize\u201d your energy and land use, while surrendering all of your \u201cnatural assets\u201d in ways that benefit the \u201ccommunities\u201d (big government). That\u2019s right, the Scottish government is planning \u201cfuture places\u201d where people can walk around or drive a few miles to escape their home prisons. This is also called \u201clocal living\u201d and \u201cgreen space\u201d under the UN goal\u2019s documented \u201cNational Planning Framework.\u201d\n\n\u201cNational Spatial Strategy\u201d spells out \u201cliveable places\u201d and \u201cproductive places\u201d meaning work from home and never leave, except for government-supervised local movements\n\nScotland is just a litmus test for the rest of the world. Have no doubts that once this is implemented and the populace succumbs, it will become a law of the New World Order, run by NATO police and the globalists, to keep the whole world on climate lockdown. This is not a Marvel movie where a few superheroes must save the planet from the sun\u2019s heat bursting all of the humans into flames next month. This is reality, even though the earth is in a slow cooling phase that won\u2019t affect humans for about a million more years. That\u2019s why you should follow the science, not the rogue governments and their insane mandates, if you want to survive this.\n\nScotland\u2019s Climate Change Plan is focused on achieving \u201cnet zero emissions by 2045,\u201d meaning their economy will be completely wrecked, the citizens all starving to death, zero employment outside of working from home off a phone or computer, and total government tyranny. The \u201cneed to travel\u201d will be reduced by 20%, periodically, until no person shall leave their home ever again, for anything, in order to save earth from global burning.\n\nNo person in Scotland will be allowed to travel more than 20 minutes from their home, and just how soon until even that is reduced to 10, 5, 1, then zero? It\u2019s like when the governments said everyone would have to wear Covid masks for just a couple weeks, to flatten out the curve, then we would all go back to normal. Remember that? How did that work out?",
