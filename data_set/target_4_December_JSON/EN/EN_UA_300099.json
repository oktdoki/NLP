As things stand today, the United States has not adjusted our nuclear posture, but it is something that we monitor day by day, hour by hour, because it is a paramount priority to the president.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the Biden administration was \u201cconcerned\u201d about the situation, Sullivan said, \u201cAnytime you have a nuclear power fighting in a conflict zone in Europe near NATO territory, of course we have to focus on and be concerned about the possibility of escalation, the risk of escalation.\u201d\n\nHowever, Sullivan again doubled down on his previous comment that officials \u201chave not seen anything that would require us to change our nuclear posture at this time.\u201d\n\nWithin days of invading Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces on high alert, blaming the \u201chostile actions\u201d and statements of Western nations and NATO.\n\n\u201cWestern countries are not only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic area. I\u2019m speaking about the illegitimate sanctions that everyone is well aware of. However, the top officials of the leading NATO countries also make aggressive statements against our country as well,\u201d Putin said in a televised meeting with top ministers.\n\nAs a result, Putin said that he has ordered \u201cthe minister of defense and the chief of the general staff [of the Russian armed forces] to transfer the deterrence forces of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty.\u201d\n\nThe deterrence forces include command of Russia\u2019s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons, although it is unclear what a \u201cspecial mode of combat duty\u201d refers to.\n\nPutin\u2019s order means that Russia\u2019s nuclear weapons are prepared for the increased possibility of launch, raising the possibility that Western nations could be subject to nuclear strikes if they get too involved in the Ukraine conflict.\n\nHowever, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on March 9 called Putin\u2019s threat to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine\u2013Russia conflict a \u201cbluff.\u201d\n\nOn March 13, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators said that there had been progress in talks between both sides regarding a potential end to the conflict.\n\nThe Kyiv government is continuing to demand an \u201cend of the war and the withdrawal of [Russian] troops,\u201d Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, wrote on Twitter, adding that he believes Ukraine will \u201cachieve some results literally in a matter of days.\u201d\n\nWhile both sides appear to be optimistic about the potential to end the more than two-week-long conflict, no further details were provided.",
