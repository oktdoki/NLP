Social media footage captured the confrontations near the court in Baymak, with supporters engaging in clashes with police, including throwing snowballs.\n\nViolent clashes in Baymak— NEXTA (@nexta_tv) January 17, 2024\n\nLaw enforcers used stun grenades in Baymak, Bashkortostan, Russia.

Reports suggest thousands participated in the multi-day protest in -20°C temperatures, resulting in several injuries. \n\nThe activist denies the charges related to insulting migrants during a demonstration against gold mining plans. Supporters claim the case is retaliation for Alsynov’s activism against soda mining in a culturally significant area. He allegedly referred to Central Asians and Caucasians, comprising a significant portion of Russia’s migrant population, as “black people” in the Bashkir language. \n\nAlsynov contends the Bashkir words meant “poor people” and were mistranslated into Russian. He plans to appeal the verdict. Alsynov has previously criticized military mobilization in the region as “genocide” against the Bashkir people. Ongoing concerns exist about the disproportionate deployment of ethnic minorities, including Bashkirs, in conflicts such as Ukraine. \n\nAlsynov was a leader of Bashkort, a grassroots movement focused on preserving Bashkir ethnic identity, which was banned as extremist in 2020. The clashes signify a rare instance of public dissent in Russia, underscoring the intensity of emotions surrounding Alsynov’s case and broader issues of ethnic identity and activism in the country.",
