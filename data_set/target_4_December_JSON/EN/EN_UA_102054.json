    "text": "UK Intelligence Experts Concerned Russia Will Use \u2018Fabricated\u2019 Chemical Weapons Claims in \u2018False-Flag\u2019 Attack on Ukraine \n\n UK intelligence experts are concerned that Russia will use \u201cfabricated\u201d claims regarding chemical weapons in Ukraine to move forward with a \u201cfalse-flag operation.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia could possibly be planning to use chemical or biological weapons in a \u2018false-flag\u2019 operation. Such an operation could take the form of a faked attack, a staged \u2018discovery\u2019 of agents or munitions, or fabricated evidence of alleged Ukrainian planning to use such weapons,\u201d officials said, adding that such a \u201cfalse-flag\u201d attack would \u201calmost certainly be accompanied by extensive disinformation to complicate attribution.\u201d\n\nOfficials added that intelligence suggests that Moscow had likely intended to use false-flag operations as justification for its invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nHowever, analysts believe that the narrative is part of the Kremlin\u2019s plan to create a false-flag operation in an attempt to justify using chemical weapons operations in Ukraine itself.\n\nYet both the United States and Ukraine maintain that the laboratories seek to prevent bioweapons and pathogens, a project backed by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, an agency within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).\n\nIn response to Russia\u2019s allegations, State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement that the disinformation being spread by Russia is \u201ctotal nonsense and not the first time Russia has invented such false claims against another country.\u201d\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence\u2019s report comes as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned on March 13 that the Kremlin might use chemical or biological weapons in its invasion of Ukraine, which would amount to a war crime.\n\nThe NATO Secretary General echoed comments by the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defense that Russia could be using the claims to create a false pretext to justify its actions.\n\n\u201cNow that these false claims have been made, we must remain vigilant because it is possible that Russia itself could plan chemical weapons operations under this fabrication of lies. That would be a war crime,\u201d Price said.",
