Many of those working disclosure are subject matter experts,. While disclosure to the Inquiry is a priority, there have been times when this has had to take second place behind live, ongoing issues of national security.\u201d\n\nMcGahey testifed before Hughes at a two-hour hearing on the Novichok allegations in a London courtroom last Friday, November 11. Follow what was said, and what was meant, in this analysis. An official transcript of the hearing can be read here.\n\nAccording to McGahey, \u201capproximately 80,000 documents (including emails) have been identified and located as relevant\u201d to the Hughes inquiry. But before any of them can be identified, quoted, or released publicly, McGahey suggested, the government\u2019s Ukraine warfighters will be obliged to down their weapons and pick up censorship tools to prevent the Russians from gaining any advantage.\n\nAs Hughes has announced, referring to the allegations of Novichok poisoning, \u201cthe responsibility for the events in Salisbury [Skripal incident March 4, 2018] and Amesbury [Sturgess incident June 30, 2018] is what is to be decided by this Inquiry. There is, however, at least a prima facie case (denied by those accused) that those responsible were Russian nationals acting in the interests of the Russian state and allegedly under its direction.\u201d\n\nExactly what roles in the Ukraine war the \u201csubject matter experts\u201d are playing has not been disclosed. The Russian Government has publicly accused the British Government of providing undersea drone and other technology for attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines, Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, a plan of attack against the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, and nuclear weapons design.\n\nMcGahey told Hughes the British Government hasn\u2019t enough money to pay these warfighters to do both the Ukrainian and the Novichok jobs. \u201cThere are stretched resources and budgets across HMG [HHis Majesty\u2019s Government], which are not trivial, and there is very real pressure on government departments and agencies.\u201d\n\nHughes has decided there must be a near-total ban on identifying by name any British official engaged in warmaking against Russia, including intelligence gathering, weapons training, plans and operations.\n\n\u201cThe risk of damage to national security here,\u201d he said, \u201d lies in the risk that hostile actors, whether State or otherwise and, if State, whether Russian or otherwise, might target individuals identified as concerned in the UK reaction to those events, and/or might use access to their names as a means of disrupting UK public functions. I am satisfied, on all the material I have seen, both OPEN and CLOSED, that these are marked real risks to some of those who were involved in the 2018 events, and that Russia in particular has both an interest in such activity and a known capacity to carry it out. For most of these persons therefore, a restriction order is likely to be necessary\u2026 [Russia] would have a similar interest in anyone amongst government staff who carried out any sensitive role; an obvious example would be any person concerned in the work of intelligence agencies, or other covert activities, but the risk will not be limited to them. General disclosure of the names of persons subject to these risks would indeed present a hostile actor with a convenient directory of suitable targets and/or a list of sensitive functions which would be of considerable value to a hostile actor accumulating intelligence about UK security and government systems.\u201d\n\nLeave a Reply",
