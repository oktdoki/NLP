    "text": "Despite Yields Doubling, NYTimes Claims Vanilla Is Disappearing From Climate Change \n\n The New York Times is attempting to stoke climate alarm this week with an article claiming the world\u2019s favorite scent \u2013 vanilla \u2013 is about to disappear because climate change is eradicating vanilla plants. [emphasis, links added]\n\nIn reality, objective data show vanilla production has doubled since the year 2000, and the current market is saturated with oversupply.\n\nThe Times article, \u201cThis Is How the World\u2019s Favorite Scent Disappears,\u201d notes vanilla is the world\u2019s favorite scent and is used in a wide variety of perfumes and other products.\n\nCiting anecdotal events like a cyclone that hit Madagascar several years ago during its annual cyclone season, the Times claims supersized cyclones are putting vanilla plants on the verge of extinction.\n\nInterestingly, although the Times published its article just yesterday, the best anecdotal \u201cevidence\u201d for the asserted vanilla extinction was a cyclone that hit Madagascar way back in 2017 during its cyclone season.\n\nAccording to the Times, Madagascar produces 80 percent of the world\u2019s vanilla \u2013 actually, it produces significantly less than 80 percent \u2013 and:\n\n\u201cAs a result [of the 2017 cyclone], the price of vanilla bean pods surged to nearly $300 a pound. The increasingly erratic weather, along with pressure to cut the forests that harbor the orchids, is particularly worrisome for farmers\u2026\u201d\n\nSo, why does the Times provide just anecdotal \u2018evidence\u2019 of climate change ravaging vanilla crops, and why does the Times have to go back to 2017 to find any such anecdotal evidence?\n\nThe answer is that objective facts expose the Times\u2019 claim as false.\n\nThe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization provides detailed information on global crop production, including vanilla. According to the UN data, global vanilla production has doubled from 3.9 million kg of vanilla in 2000 to 7.7 million kg in 2022.\n\nThere is so much vanilla being produced that farmers are complaining about low vanilla prices caused by overproduction.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 vanilla crop is expected to be one of the best harvests in the last two decades, forecasted at 2,500 tons with exceptionally high quality,\u201d observes the Nielsen-Massey 2023 Crop Report.\n\nThe Crop Report observes that recent strong production has created a market oversupply. \u201cThe oversupply has led to aggressive price reductions, posing economic challenges for vanilla farmers as they sell their 2022 crop at low prices to meet their daily living needs,\u201d the Crop Report adds.\n\nWow, talk about the New York Times getting the story completely backward and wrong!\n\nThe New York Times points to a cyclone that hit Madagascar seven years ago during its cyclone season and caused a very short-term spike in vanilla prices.\n\nThat is its sole \u201cevidence\u201d of climate change making vanilla go extinct.\n\nIn reality, vanilla production is so strong that the market is saturated with vanilla, \u2026 making farmers complain about low prices.\n\nThe New York Times and other \u201cmainstream\u201d media outlets have a long history of identifying popular foods, beverages, and luxury items that climate change is allegedly destroying.\n\nAs is the case with all other such items that have come to Climate Realism\u2019s attention, vanilla is becoming more abundant rather than less abundant as the planet modestly warms.\n\nTop photo of the Vanilla bean plant by Kristy An on Unsplash\n\n",
