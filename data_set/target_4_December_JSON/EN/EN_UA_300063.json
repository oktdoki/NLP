Can that one war bring the entire world to a standstill?\"\n\n\"Nutrition has been impacted, health outcomes have been impacted, learning outcomes have been impacted, people have become stunted and wasted and we are just concerned with one Russia and Ukraine war,\" Kant said. \"The world needs to move on and Europe needs to find a solution to its challenges.\"\n\nIndian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has said Europe must grow out of the mindset that its problems are the world's problems but the world's problems are not Europe's problems.\n\nIndia has declined to blame Russia for the war and has sought a diplomatic solution while boosting its purchases of Russian oil.\n\nKant said it is \"premature\" to even talk about whether US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin would attend a summit of leaders of the bloc in New Delhi on Sept. 9-10.\n\nThe Kremlin said on Monday that it was not ruling out Putin attending the summit.\n\nPutin has not travelled beyond the former Soviet Union since sending his armed forces into Ukraine in February last year, and missed November's G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia.\n\nThe G20 includes the rich G7 nations as well as Russia, China, India, Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia, among other countries.\n\n",
