According to the latest request, the country says Israel’s military incursion in Rafah threatens the “very survival of Palestinians in Gaza”.\n\nDuring hearings earlier this year, Israel strongly denied committing genocide in Gaza, saying it does all it can to spare civilians and is only targeting Hamas militants. Israel says Rafah is the last stronghold of the militant group.\n\nIn January, judges ordered Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza, but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.\n\nThe court has already found that there is a “real and imminent risk” to the Palestinian people in Gaza by Israel’s military operations.\n\n“This may well be the last chance for the court to act,” said Irish lawyer Blinne Ni Ghralaigh, who is part of South Africa’s legal team.\n\nICJ judges have broad powers to order a ceasefire and other measures, though the court does not have its own enforcement apparatus.\n\nA 2022 order by the court demanding that Russia halt its full-scale invasion of Ukraine has so far gone unheeded.\n\nMost of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people have been displaced since fighting began.\n\nThe war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 in which Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry says more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war without distinguishing between civilians and combatants in its count.\n\nSouth Africa initiated proceedings in December 2023 and sees the legal campaign as rooted in issues central to its identity. Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Blacks to “homelands”. Apartheid ended in 1994.\n\nOn Sunday, Egypt announced it plans to join the case. Several countries have also indicated they plan to intervene, but only Libya, Nicaragua and Colombia have filed formal requests to do so.\n\nJoin the Belfast Telegraph WhatsApp channel\n\nStay up to date with some of Northern Ireland's biggest stories",
