Instead, Russia is fighting \"for the survival of Russian statehood, for the future development of the country and our children.\"\n\n\"In order to bring peace and stability closer, we, of course, need to show the consolidation and composure of our society. When the enemy sees that our society is strong, internally braced up, consolidated, then, without any doubt we will come to reach what we are striving for \u2014 both success and victory,\" Putin said.\n\nAccording to him, many of the current problems began after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when they tried to put pressure on Russia to \"destabilise the internal political situation.\u201d \"Hordes of international terrorists\" new sent to the purpose to accomplish this goal, Putin said.\n\nAfterwards, the West decided to start rehabilitating Nazism in Russia's neighbouring states, including in Ukraine.\n\nNevertheless, Putin continued, Russia had long tried to build partnerships with both Western countries and Ukraine. However, after 2014, when the West contributed to the coup in Ukraine, the state of affairs changed dramatically.
