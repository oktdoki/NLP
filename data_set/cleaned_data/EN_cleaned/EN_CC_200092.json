They use what is called the United States Historical Climatology Network (USHCN), which has physical stations all over the country.\n\nBut, the problem is, a large number of the stations they claim to be using don’t even exist.\n\nSo, how does NOAA use temperature data that doesn’t exist?\n\nWill this presidential election be the most important in American history?\n\nPer Zero Hedge:\n\nThe problem, say experts, is that an increasing number of USHCN’s stations don’t exist anymore.\n\n“They are physically gone—but still report data—like magic,” said Lt. Col. John Shewchuk, a certified consulting meteorologist.\n\n“NOAA fabricates temperature data for more than 30 percent of the 1,218 USHCN reporting stations that no longer exist.”\n\nHe calls them “ghost” stations.\n\nMr. Shewchuck said USHCN stations reached a maximum of 1,218 stations in 1957, but after 1990 the number of active stations began declining due to aging equipment and personnel retirements.\n\nNOAA still records data from these ghost stations by taking the temperature readings from surrounding stations, and recording their average for the ghost station, followed by an “E,” for estimate.\n\nSo much for “science.”\n\nIf you can’t prove it… just make it up.\n\nThis is from the “trust the science” fools.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, or Truth Social @WarnerToddHuston\n\nCross-posted with The Lid\n\nRelated:\n\n- Next Loony Liberal Crusade: They Want to Take Your Coffee Away — For Global Warming, Of Course (Video)\n\n- COP28 Head Tells Crowd There’s “No Science” Backing Phase-Out Of Fossil Fuels To Stop Global Warming\n\n- Norway Study Concludes There Is NO Man-Made Global Warming\n\n- Bill Gates Bankrolling DESTRUCTION OF ALL TREES To Stop “Global Warming” (Video)\n\n- Will Biden Block Sunlight To Cut Global Warming?\n\nTurn your back on Big Tech oligarchs and join the New Resistance NOW!
