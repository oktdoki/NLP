    "text": "French Party Leader Claims Large Part Of Ukraine Aid Has Been Stolen \n\n A top French politician has claimed that a large part of Western aid to Kiev is being embezzled by Ukrainian officials, despite President Zelensky\u2019s assurances that it is being used in the fight against Russia.\n\nFlorian Philippot, leader of the Patriots (Les Patriotes) party and a long-time critic of Western assistance to Ukraine has alleged that Zelensky was lying when he claimed that all US aid to his country \u201cgoes to the battlefield.\u201d\n\nIn a social media post on Friday he wrote: \u201cIn reality a large part is diverted and goes into corruption!\u201d\n\nRT reports: He noted Kiev\u2019s admission last month that it had not received \u20ac16 billion ($17.1 billion) in aid collected by Poland and the European Commission. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal claimed he had \u201cno idea\u201d what happened to the funds.\n\nPhilippot also pointed to a recent corruption scandal involving Ukrainian Agriculture Minister Nikolay Solsky, who is accused of illegally appropriating state land worth nearly \u20ac6.9 million ($7.4 million). \u201cYet another case of corruption in this country, which is one of the most corrupt on the planet!\u201d the French politician remarked.\n\n\u201cEvery euro sent to Ukraine prolongs the war and therefore causes unnecessary deaths, impoverishes us here, and has a strong chance of enriching the corrupt!\u201d he added, calling for the conflict to be resolved as soon as possible.\n\nUkraine has been plagued by widespread graft for years, and a 2015 Guardian article described it as \u201cthe most corrupt nation in Europe.\u201d More recently, it ranked 104 out of 180 countries in Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index.\n\nThe issue has taken center stage during the conflict with Russia, including in the Ukrainian military, which has been rocked by several graft scandals in recent months. This winter, Ukraine\u2019s SBU, the successor to the Soviet-era KGB, announced that it had uncovered a major embezzlement scheme in which Ukrainian officials and private contractors stole around $40 million earmarked for shell procurement.\n\nElsewhere, the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general admitted that Washington had failed to properly track more than $1 billion in weapons sent to Ukraine, although this did not stop US officials from claiming that they believed the assistance to have reached its intended destination.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, has for months been warning about the spillover of foreign weapons sent to Ukraine, cautioning that they are ending up in the hands of organized crime outside of the country.",
