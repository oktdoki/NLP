    "text": "Pence calls viral clip suggesting he cares more about Ukraine than US \u2018fake news\u2019 \n\n Former Vice President Mike Pence fired back on social media after an out-of-context video clip of him suggesting he\u2019s more interested in the war in Ukraine than issues plaguing cities across the US went viral on Friday.\n\nIn the video, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson questions the 2024 Republican presidential candidate about where his priorities lie after Pence criticizes the length of time it has taken the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with weapons to fend off Russia\u2019s invasion of the former Soviet state.\n\n\u201cYou are distressed that the Ukrainians don\u2019t have enough American tanks. Every city in the United States has become much worse over the past three years. Drive around. There\u2019s not one city that\u2019s gotten better in the United States, and it\u2019s visible,\u201d Carlson says during a forum at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa.\n\n\u201cOur economy has degraded, the suicide rate has jumped, public filth and disorder and crime have exponentially increased, and yet, your concern is that the Ukrainians \u2013 a country most people can\u2019t find out a map \u2013 who\u2019ve received tens of billions of US tax dollars don\u2019t have enough tanks. I think it\u2019s a fair question to ask, like, where\u2019s the concern for the United States in that?\u201d Carlson asks Pence.\n\nTo which Pence responds, \u201cIt\u2019s not my concern. Tucker, I\u2019ve heard that routine from you before, but that\u2019s not my concern.\u201d\n\nSeveral conservatives on social media seized on the clip, including Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, who shared a snippet of the exchange on Twitter and wrote, \u201cTucker Carlson just brutalized Mike Pence for prioritizing Ukraine despite a litany of social ills afflicting America.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president shot back at Kirk on social media, sharing a clip with his full answer to Carlson that showed him explaining that under a Pence administration, the country would be able to tackle both issues affecting Ukraine and domestic problems at the same time.\n\n\u201cSorry [Charlie Kirk]. That is what we used to call FAKE NEWS. Here\u2019s the full clip of my remarks if you\u2019re interested,\u201d Pence wrote in his tweet.\n\nIn the extended clip, Pence continues his response to Carlson by saying, \u201cAnybody that says that we can\u2019t be the leader of the free world and solve our problems at home has a pretty small view of the greatest nation on Earth. We can do both.\n\n\u201cAnd as president of the United States, we will secure our border, we will support our military, we will revive our economy and stand by our values. And we will also lead the world for freedom under my administration. I promise you.\u201d\n\nPence made an unannounced visit to Kyiv late last month and became the first declared 2024 Republican contender to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe 64-year-old made the trip with Samaritan\u2019s Purse, an evangelical Christian humanitarian organization that the former vice president previously accompanied to Poland and Ukraine, a Pence adviser said.\n\n\u201cI really do believe that if Vladimir Putin and the Russian military were to overrun Ukraine, it wouldn\u2019t be too long before they cross the border where our men and women would be required to fight,\u201d Pence, an outspoken backer of the Ukrainian war effort and providing US military support for the country, told NBC News in June.",
