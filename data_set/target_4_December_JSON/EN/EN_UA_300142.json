    "text": "Former Top FBI Official Pleads Guilty in Scheme to Help Russian Oligarch \n\n A former high-ranking FBI counterintelligence official pleaded guilty on Tuesday to conspiracy and money laundering as he admitted to working for a Russian oligarch he once investigated after leaving the agency. His actions violated the sanctions against Russia.\n\nExpressing deep remorse, Charles McGonigal pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to one count of conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) for the purpose of money laundering.\n\nAccording to testimony before Judge Jennifer H. Rearden, Mr. McGonigal committed his violation of the IEEPA during the spring and fall of 2021, when he accepted over $17,000 to assist Russian energy mogul Oleg Deripaska by gathering negative information about one of Deripaska\u2019s competitors.\n\nSentencing is set Dec. 14 for Mr. McGonigal, 55, who could spend up to five years in prison.\n\n\u201cAfter his tenure as a high-level FBI official who supervised and participated in investigations of Russian oligarchs, Charles McGonigal has now admitted that he agreed to evade U.S. sanctions by providing services to one of those oligarchs, Oleg Deripaska,\u201c U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said, according to the press release. \u201dThis Office will continue to hold to account those who violate U.S. sanctions for their own financial benefit.\u201d\n\nMr. Williams lauded the exceptional performance of the FBI New York Field Office\u2019s Counterintelligence Division as well as the assistance provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the New York City Police Department.\n\nThe Former Agent\u2019s PositionFrom 2016 to 2018, Mr. McGonigal oversaw the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence operations in New York as special agent in charge. He directed probes of Russian oligarchs such as Deripaska, who was sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury in 2018.\n\nIn 2018, Washington banned nearly two dozen Russian billionaires and government officials in response to the now-debunked allegations of collusion between then-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government. Among those targeted was Mr. Deripaska, the founder of Russian aluminum firm Rusal.\n\nMr. Deripaska\u2019s sanctions were upheld by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after the court found evidence he had acted as an agent for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nMr. McGonigal, who wept as he spoke about his crime, said Mr. Deripaska had sent him at least $17,000 via a bank in Cypress and a firm in New Jersey before depositing the money into his bank account.\n\nIn January 2023, authorities alleged that Mr. McGonigal had received undisclosed payments from Mr. Deripaska in exchange for investigating a rival oligarch and unsuccessfully pushing to lift U.S. sanctions on the Russian billionaire.\n\nAccording to a news release issued by the Department of Justice on Jan. 23, it was alleged that Mr. McGonigal, on behalf of Mr. Deripaska, \u201cfraudulently used a U.S. entity to obscure their activity in violation of U.S. sanctions.\u201d\n\nConnection to TrumpMr. McGonigal joined the FBI in 1996 and worked on Russian foreign counterintelligence and organized crime before taking part in probes into the crash of TWA Flight 800, the 1998 terrorist bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.\n\nIn 2016, he was promoted to head of the FBI\u2019s New York Field Office\u2019s Counterintelligence Division.\n\nThe DOJ was able to monitor Mr. Page\u2019s communications because of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant issued during President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. Former Department of Justice assertions that Mr. Page was \u201ccollaborating and conspiring with the Russian government\u201d and had been the target of Russian intelligence recruitment efforts have since been debunked.\n\nMr. Page has always denied any collusion with the Russian government and has never been indicted in the Trump campaign probes.",
