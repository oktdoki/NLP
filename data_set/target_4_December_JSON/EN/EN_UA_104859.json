According to him, the $6 million bribe that was paid in cash to shut down the investigation into the First Son\u2019s scandal eventually found its way to the Ukrainian Armed Forces and its military-intelligence agency.\n\nDerkach claimed to have proof of the secret court order that divided these funds between those two, with the first investing its portion into building up their country\u2019s drone army while the second financed terrorist attacks like the assassination of Darya Dugina, which he specifically mentioned in the interview. These allegations expand upon the ones that he shared earlier this year regarding the real-world impact of Hunter\u2019s corruption scandal, which were analyzed here at the time.\n\nOn the subject of Ukrainian assassinations and terrorism, Derkach said that the CIA and FBI actually condone these actions despite their public claims to the contrary, but he warned that this immoral policy will inevitably ricochet into the US itself. In particular, he cited FBI chief Christopher Wray\u2019s testimony to Congress last April where he said that law enforcement officials fear that Crocus-like attacks are presently being plotted against their country.\n\nAbout that, it shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that Ukraine\u2019s military-intelligence service GUR is the chief suspect of Russia\u2019s investigation into what became one of the worst terrorist attacks in its history, thus meaning that the portion of Burisma\u2019s $6 million bribe that made its way into their hands likely financed part of it. In other words, the third-order effect of Hunter\u2019s corruption scandal is that it was partially responsible for the brutal murder of innocent civilians halfway across the world some years later.\n\nThat\u2019s already scandalous enough, but Derkach shared even more details about the other indirect consequences of this cover-up into the First Son\u2019s illicit activities, adding that some GUR-linked figures have been connected to the Western narrative about September 2022\u2019s Nord Stream terrorist attack. He regards that story as a distraction from the US\u2019 complicity, the view of which was elaborated upon here at the time that it entered the discourse, but lauded the CIA for the lengths it went to cover up its role.\n\nIn his view, the CIA might very well have sent a highly trained Ukrainian diving team to the Baltic Sea exactly as the Western media reported, though only to plant fake bombs. In his words, \u201cwhen a cover story is made, it is done quite well. We shouldn\u2019t belittle the experience of the CIA or the experience of MI6 in preparing cover operations. They have quite a lot of experience in using proxies, in using cover stories to form a certain position in order to dodge responsibility. This is actually what happened.\u201d\n\nLooking forward, Derkach expects Ukraine to attempt more terrorist attacks against Russia, which the US public is being preconditioned to accept via the CIA\u2019s various leaks to the media. While many might lay the blame for all this on Zelensky\u2019s lap, Derkach believes that it\u2019s actually his Chief of Staff Andrey Yermak who\u2019s running the show, albeit as a Western puppet. Nevertheless, he\u2019s also convinced that the West is indeed preparing to formally replace Zelensky, but doesn\u2019t yet know when or with whom.\n\nAltogether, the importance of Derkach\u2019s interview is that he\u2019s a former veteran Ukrainian politician who still retains a lot of sources inside the regime, having served in the Rada for a whopping 22 years from 1998-2020. While his homeland charged him with treason after he fled to Russia in early 2022, which followed the US charging him with election meddling on behalf of that country in September 2020, the argument can be made that these are politically driven attempts to intimidate a top whistleblower.\n\nThe dirt that Derkach shared about Hunter\u2019s Burisma corruption scandal, not to mention its newly revealed third-order effects that led to the brutal killing of civilians halfway across the world after part of his company\u2019s bribe made its way into GUR\u2019s hands, made him an enemy of the US Government. They and their Ukrainian proxies will therefore always try to discredit him with sensational allegations, but everyone would do well to listen to what he says and then make up their own minds about it.",
