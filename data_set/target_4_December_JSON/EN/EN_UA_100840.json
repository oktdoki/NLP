It is going to be the most debilitating strike on America, possibly ever.\n\n\u201cAnd we may not recover from it in a timely fashion. This could be how we lose our first war on Earth is losing the war in space.\u201d\n\nWeichert slammed the \"arrogant\" DC political class, claiming they didn\u2019t foresee any rival challenging Washington\u2019s dominance in the post-Cold-War world.\n\nMost read in The Sun\n\nHe said: \u201cThey thought there would never be a need for any kind of preventative or security measure because we thought we would always be dominant, and we thought no one would be crazy enough to challenge us.\n\n\u201cWell here we are 30 years later, and you have Russia, China, North Korea, and even Iran showing us that it was the wrong assumption.\u201d\n\nThe expert feared that the US has a 60 percent chance of being pushed out of space by its rivals completely.\n\nPresident Biden unleashed a package of sanctions against Moscow on Thursday after Putin\u2019s forces rolled into Ukraine.\n\nAnd, an additional 7,000 troops will be sent to Eastern Europe to bolster Nato\u2019s defenses.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of the besieged nation saw Europe plunged into its biggest crisis since World War II.\n\nExperts claim the world has not seen a crisis since the Cuban Missile Crisis in the 1960s.\n\nThe flashpoint was the closest point the world came to a full-blown nuclear war.\n\nUS intelligence feared that Kyiv could fall within 96 hours and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it\u2019s a \u201cpossibility\u201d that Putin could move beyond the borders of Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian strongman may feel emboldened and seek to move on to other nations if successful.\n\nTroops have reportedly already been spotted in the Belarussian city of Brest \u2013 10 miles east of the Polish border.\n\nBiden told reporters Thursday: \u201cHe has much larger ambitions. He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union. That\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d\n\nWeichert said: \u201cIf Putin suspects the West will prop up a formidable anti-Russian resistance in a post-invasion Ukraine, he will risk not only nuclear war but also will threaten to attack US assets in space and the ISS.\n\n\u201cPutin fully understands the concept of asymmetrical warfare.\u201d\n\nHe speculated that Moscow will ramp up its threats in cyberspace and nuclear warfare.\n\nPUTIN'S THREATS\n\nIn December, Weichert warned that Moscow is plotting to launch a Pearl Harbor attack on the US in the cosmos.\n\nThe Pearl Harbor attack of December 1941 left America reeling as Japanese forces bombed the US naval port.\n\nIn his book, Winning Space: How America Remains a Superpower, Weichert says that Russian co-orbital satellites, known as space stalkers, have been tailgating US satellites for years.\n\nHe predicts that the stalkers will eventually hit the satellites, sending them crashing into the ground.\n\nWeichert believes Russia is preparing to launch a \"devastating\" attack on American satellites at the time of its own choice.\n\nHe warned that before launching an attack on Washington\u2019s satellites, Moscow would \"engage in a series of escalations\u201d with neighboring nations.\n\nRussia conducted an anti-satellite weapon test (ASAT) in November where it destroyed one of its own satellites that had been in orbit since 1982.\n\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\n\nBlinken branded the test \"dangerous and irresponsible\" as it created a field of 1,500 pieces of debris, forcing the ISS crew to take shelter.\n\nState Department spokesperson Ned Price said the test marked an increase in the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS.\n\nWe pay for your stories!\n\nDo you have a story for The US Sun team?\n\nEmail us at exclusive@the-sun.com or call 212 416 4552.\n\nLike us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/TheSunUS and follow us from our main Twitter account at @TheSunUS",
