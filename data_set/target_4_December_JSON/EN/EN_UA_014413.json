We hacked him\".\n\nThe hack is considered to appear \"pretty credible\" by Ukrainian hacking expert Stefan Soesanto, of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.\n\nInfo Nampalm reported that the hack confirmed Morgachev's identity by sifting through stolen personnel files.\n\nAmong these was a document that showed him to be a department head in Unit 26165.\n\nThe Russian hacker was accused by the FBI of holding the same position in 2018.\n\nHe is on the FBI's wanted list for his part in hacking senior US Democrats including Hillary Clinton ahead of Donald Trump's presidential election in 2016.\n\nIt is said Morgachev and the GRU \"knowingly and intentionally conspired\u2026 to gain unauthorised access into the computers of US persons and entities involved in the 2016 US presidential election,\" according to a federal indictment filed by the Department of Justice.\n\nIn the document, he is described by the FBI as an officer in Russia's military spy agency, in a department \"dedicated to developing and managing malware.\"\n\nThis was said to include the \"X-Agent\" spy software used to hack the DNC.\n\nMicrosoft later revealed in 2020 that the US election was targeted by the Russian group who launched attacks on people in both the Trump and the Biden campaign.",
