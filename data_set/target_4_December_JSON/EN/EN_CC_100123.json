The lies to generate fear and justify dystopia are absolutely shocking \n\n A top mosquito expert has blasted Professor Dame Jenny Harries\u2019s claim that climate change will make dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases common in the U.K. within 20 years, branding it \u201centirely fictional\u201d and \u201cshameless\u201d.\n\nProfessor Harries, who heads the U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA), recently said that rising temperatures will make such diseases common in the U.K. by 2040 because the Asian Tiger Mosquito \u2013 which can transmit dengue, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever and other viral diseases \u2013 will become established throughout Britain. Dengue will become endemic in London, she claimed.\n\nBut Professor Paul Reiter, retired Professor of Insects and Infectious Diseases at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and a leading expert in mosquito-borne diseases, has ridiculed her claims. He told Net Zero Watch:\n\nThe natural range of the Tiger mosquito, an Asian species, extends from the tropics to regions where mean January temperatures are around \u201310\u00b0C. Northern strains are able to survive because in late summer, as days grow shorter, the eggs they lay are dormant and remain unhatched until spring arrives.\n\nIt is true that since the late 1970s, there has been rapid global spread of the Tiger mosquito to the United States, Latin America, Europe and across Africa, probably mainly via the global trade in used tyres. Professor Reiter says that it is beyond doubt that this has nothing at all to do with temperature.\n\nProfessor Reiter has also lambasted fearmongering about the return of malaria, noting that this was once a major cause of death in many parts of England, even during the Little Ice Age from the 1300s to the 1800s, and its disappearance was, once again, nothing to do with temperature:\n\nShakespeare mentions malaria \u2013 \u201cthe ague\u201d \u2013 13 times, so it was clearly once common here. The disease began to decline \u2013 for a multitude of reasons \u2013 in the mid-19th century, despite the upward trend in global temperatures.\n\nNet Zero Watch Director Andrew Montford said:\n\nThis is not the first time we have seen the Civil Service misleading the public in this way. Science is being misused to generate fear and to \u2018nudge\u2019 us in a desired direction. This kind of shameful disinformation brings the Civil Service into disrepute.\n\nBut it seems our public officials won\u2019t miss an opportunity to bang the climate alarmist drum as they attempt to cajole and coerce the public into accepting radical cuts in living standards to ward off threats based solely on the perennially wrong outputs of biased computer models.\n\nRead More: \u201cEntirely Fictional, Shameless\u201d: Top Mosquito Expert Blasts Dame Jenny Harries\u2019s Claim That Climate Change Will Make Dengue Fever Common in U.K. Within 20 Years",
