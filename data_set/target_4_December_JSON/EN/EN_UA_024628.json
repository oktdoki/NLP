    "text": "Washington will not let Ukraine fail, US defence chief vows \n\n RAMSTEIN AIR BASE - Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised Tuesday that the United States will not let Ukraine fail in fighting off Russia, even as further aid remains stalled in Congress and Kyiv\u2019s forces face shortages of munitions.\n\nThe Republican-led House of Representatives has been blocking $60 billion in assistance for Ukraine and the United States has warned that a recent $300 million package would only last a few weeks.\n\nThe \u201cUnited States will not let Ukraine fail\u201d, Austin said at the opening of a meeting in Germany of Ukraine\u2019s international supporters, at which he is seeking to secure further assistance for Kyiv.\n\n\u201cWe remain determined to provide Ukraine with the resources that it needs to resist the Kremlin\u2019s aggression,\u201d he said. Washington announced $300 million in assistance for Ukraine last week, but Austin said it was only possible due to savings on recent purchases.\n\n\u201cWe were only able to support this much-needed package by identifying some unanticipated contract savings\u201d, Austin said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement the day before that it is \u201ccritically important for us that the Congress soon completes all the necessary procedures and makes a final decision\u201d on aid for Kyiv.\n\nTop US military officer General Charles \u201cCQ\u201d Brown told journalists en route to the Ukraine meeting that Kyiv\u2019s troops are \u201chaving to pay attention to their supply rates and how they execute.\u201d There is an \u201cincremental kind of back and forth between Ukraine and Russia\u201d, with \u201cincremental gains on both sides\u201d, Brown said.\n\nBut he noted that \u201ceven as the Russians have gained territory, they do it at a pretty big cost in number of casualties, like in personnel, but also in number of pieces of equipment that are being taken out.\u201d\n\nAustin said in his remarks Tuesday that \u201cRussia has paid a staggering cost for (President Vladimir) Putin\u2019s imperial dreams\u201d, using \u201cup to $211 billion to equip, deploy, maintain, and sustain its imperial aggression against Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least 315,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded\u201d since Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Austin said, adding that Ukraine has also \u201csunk, destroyed, or damaged some 20 medium-to-large Russian navy vessels.\u201d\n\nThe sinkings have been an embarrassment for Moscow and Russian state media confirmed Tuesday that the country had replaced the head of its navy. Austin and other US officials have spearheaded the push for international support for Ukraine, quickly forging a coalition to back Kyiv after Russia invaded and coordinating aid from dozens of countries.\n\nSpeaking at the Ramstein US base, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Berlin has offered another half a million euros worth of military aid to Ukraine. \u201cThat includes 10,000 rounds of ammunition from the stock of our armed forces,\u201d he told journalists. Germany is Ukraine\u2019s second biggest donor of military support, after Washington, which has committed tens of billions of dollars to aid Kyiv since February 2022.",
