It has closed its entire 1,340 km (833 mile) border with Russia for two weeks in a bid to halt an unusually large flow of asylum seekers that Helsinki says amounts to a \u201chybrid attack\u201d orchestrated by Moscow, a charge the Kremlin denies.\n\nAsked about the Polish offer to Finland during a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \u201cThis is an absolutely redundant measure to ensure border security because there is no threat there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Finns must be clearly aware that this will pose a threat to us - an increase in the concentration of military units on our borders.\u201d\n\nAny planned deployment would be unprovoked and unjustified, said Peskov.\n\nFinland\u2019s Border Guard and the interior ministry both said they were unaware of any plan to bring Polish military advisers to Finland\u2019s eastern border.\n\nFinnish President Sauli Niinisto held talks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda in Warsaw last week but they did not discuss military cooperation on the Finnish border with Russia, Niinisto\u2019s office said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nFinland infuriated Russia earlier this year when it joined NATO, ending decades of military non-alignment, due to the war in Ukraine.",
