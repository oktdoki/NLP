Chief Guterres Decries \u2018Climate-Related Carnage\u2019 from \u2018Apocalyptic Flooding\u2019 \n\n The United Nations alarmist-in-chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has denounced \u201cclimate-related carnage\u201d in Pakistan caused by \u201capocalyptic flooding.\u201d\n\nApparently unable to sympathize with those in need without invoking the bogeyman of global warming, Guterres took advantage of Pakistan\u2019s flooding plight to advance his crusade against the \u201cclimate crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will never forget the climate-related carnage I saw after apocalyptic flooding submerged a third of Pakistan,\u201d the U.N. chief declared Wednesday on Twitter (now X). \u201cI call on donors & international financial institutions to make good on their funding pledges in support of recovery efforts as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nIn a separate Tweet Wednesday, the veteran Portuguese socialist asserted that the \u201cclimate emergency is threatening the very survival of communities & economies that depend on tourism,\u201d before touting \u201cgreen investments\u201d as well as \u201cinvesting in sustainable tourism.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.N. Secretary-General, those working for real Climate Action are \u201con the right side of history\u201d since the battle to stop global warming constitutes the \u201cfight of our lives.\u201d\n\nGuterres\u2019 bombast has been heating up much faster than the environment.\n\nJust this month, Guterres said that humanity must urgently find solutions to climate change because it \u201chas opened the gates of hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cHorrendous heat is having horrendous effects,\u201d Guterres warned in his opening remarks at the U.N. Climate Ambition Summit in New York. \u201cDistraught farmers watching crops carried away by floods; sweltering temperatures spawning disease; and thousands fleeing in fear as historic fires rage.\u201d\n\nThis summer, he said that \u201cthe era of global warming has ended, the era of global boiling has arrived\u201d (emphasis added).\n\nHe also claimed that the \u201cdog days of summer are not just barking, they are biting,\u201d adding that the \u201cclimate breakdown has begun.\u201d\n\nGuterres has placed the blame for the climate crisis on \u201cour fossil fuel addiction,\u201d insisting that \u201cclimate is imploding faster than we can cope.\u201d\n\nWhile wild hyperbole and theatrical rhetoric may work in advertising, one cannot help but wonder whether they do not diminish the seriousness of Mr. Guterres\u2019 case and indeed of his office.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",
