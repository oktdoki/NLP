We predicted the UK was just getting started with their resistance, and here we have it. Taking matters into their own hands, Oxford residents are destroying street zoning barriers.\n\nNow that\u2019s quite beautiful to see.\n\nFurther action\n\nThere are further planned dates for activists to take to the streets in various forms of protest.\n\nPiers Corbyn and friends are taking to the streets on Friday the 13th of January., Starting at Southwark tube in London.\n\nThen an event which has potential to draw a large crowd with reports coming in people are making the trip down from as far as Manchester is taking place in Oxford on the 18th of February.\n\nIt\u2019s very inspiring to see the people of the UK take matters into their own hands. This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con. Continued coverage will be given on our website, newsletter and social media. Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023.\n\nIf you want to support the fight against The Climate Con, paid members get access to the 2nd part of The Climate Con Podcast. Or you can make a donation here.\n\n\n\nThe Liberty Beacon Project is now expanding at a near exponential rate, and for this we are grateful and excited! But we must also be practical. For 7 years we have not asked for any donations, and have built this project with our own funds as we grew. We are now experiencing ever increasing growing pains due to the large number of websites and projects we represent. So we have just installed donation buttons on our websites and ask that you consider this when you visit them. Nothing is too small.
