Your fighting spirit in sports is very important for us,\" he told AFP.\n\n'Really want' peace\n\nUkraine has a history of punching above its weight in disabled sport.\n\nIts Paralympic program owes its success to two and a half decades of specialized schools in every region of the country for children with disabilities, who start participating in sporting programs at an early age, Sushkevych says.\n\nUkraine finished sixth in the medal table at the Summer Paralympics in Tokyo last year, and second at the Winter Paralympics in Beijing in March, just after Russia launched its invasion.\n\nThe team's success at the Deaflympics is symbolically charged: Ukraine had finished second in the medal table at the last three editions of the event -- behind Russia, which was banned from all international competitions over the invasion.\n\n\"I dedicate these medals to Ukraine. I'm very proud to represent my country,\" said a smiling Dmytro Levin, a 24-year-old native of Kharkiv, speaking in sign language after winning two golds and a bronze in orienteering.\n\n\"I'm happy to have won this medal for Ukraine. But all I really want is peace,\" said 15-year-old Sofia Chernomorova, who won bronze in badminton.\n\n'Didn't hear the sirens'\n\nFilimoshkina said she still remembers the vibrations she felt with every bomb that exploded in Mariupol, the port city devastated by relentless Russian strikes.\n\n\"A lot of deaf people died because they didn't hear the air raid sirens and went outside at the wrong time,\" she said.\n\nHer teammate Julia Kysylova, who won silver in the hammer throw, said that for a long time, she was sure they would have to cancel their trip for the Games.\n\n\"When the war erupted, it was impossible to train. I spent a month sheltering at home,\" said the 25-year-old athlete from Nova Kakhovka, in the hard-hit southern region of Kherson.\n\nShe finally managed to flee to Spain, leaving her husband behind.\n\n\"It was a miracle we managed to cross the border. The trip took more than two days,\" she said.\n\n\"After the Games, I hope to go back home and be with my husband,\" she added.\n\n\"But I don't know if that will be possible.\"\n\n© 2022 AFP",
