Thanks to the endless bumbling of the Biden administration, Russia and China have been pushed into each other\u2019s arms, and now they seem determined to confront the western powers together. For those of you that have not been paying attention, the apocalyptic alliances that we have been anticipating for years have now formed. It is going to be the U.S. and Europe on one side, and Russia and China will be on the other. All of the marbles are at stake, and both sides have plenty of nuclear weapons.\n\nOn Tuesday, China\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi publicly declared that his nation is \u201cready to join forces with the Russian side\u201d\u2026\n\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China is ready to join forces with Russia to decisively stand up for national interests and promote mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas, Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China\u2019s Central Committee, said on Tuesday as he met with Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolay Patrushev.\n\n\u201cDuring a virtual meeting at the end of last year our leaders (Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2013 TASS) came up with a plan for further development of bilateral relations.
