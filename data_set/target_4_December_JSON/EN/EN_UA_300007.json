As we read in WIO News:\n\nUK\u2019s new top Army general General Sir Patrick Sanders has asked every soldier to prepare to fight against the Russian army in a potential World War III.\n\nGeneral Sanders, who took over from General Sir Mark Carleton Smith on Monday, told the British soldiers that they must prepare \u201cto fight in Europe once again\u201d as the conflict in Ukraine continues.\n\n\u201cThere is now a burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies and defeating Russia in battle,\u201d Sir Patrick said.\n\nAccording to The Sun, the warning came in his first speech since he became Chief of the General Staff this month, taking overall control of the British Army.\n\n\u201cWe are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the first Chief of the General Staff since 1941 to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a continental power,\u201d General Sanders added.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose \u2014 to protect the UK by being ready to fight and win wars on land.\u201d\n\n\nColumnist Mikhail Rostovsky finds it very strange that Sanders apparently believes that the war between Russia and NATO can be non-nuclear. The expert recalls that during the Cold War, an acute conflict never developed into a hot stage due to the doctrine of mutually assured destruction.\n\nFor some reason, Sanders believes that NATO will be able to fight Russia without the participation of nuclear forces. Rostovsky is surprised that in Poland there are also many who want to make war with Russia.",
