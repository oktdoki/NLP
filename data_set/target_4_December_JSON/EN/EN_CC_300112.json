    "text": "Math Confirms Foolishness of Warming Alarm \n\n The science of climate change often is presented in complicated language that speaks of computer models and the theoretical inputs and outputs thereof and concludes that the globe is on the verge of \u201cboiling.\u201d Well, leave it to three physicists -- steeped in calculus and such arcane matters as the behavior of molecules and the nuclear charge of atoms -- to simplify the analysis and arrive at a much less alarming determination.\n\n\u201cStraightforward calculations \u2026 show that eliminating U.S. CO2 emissions by the year 2050 would avoid a temperature increase of 0.0084 degrees Celsius,\u201d states a brief paper authored by Drs. Richard Lindzen, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; William Happer, Princeton University; and William A. van Wijngaarden, York University, Toronto. On the Fahrenheit scale, the value of averted warming is 0.015 \u25e6F degrees.\n\nIn short, the amount of warming averted by eliminating CO2 emissions in the United States would be too small to measure. The paper bolsters the position of those who argue that a changing climate is the product of natural forces, that human-induced carbon dioxide emissions can have only a minuscule effect on global temperature, and that CO2 is a valuable plant food and not a pollutant.\n\nRather than using theoretical assumptions about various factors that are fed into computers, the paper\u2019s calculation relies almost exclusively on \u201cobservable data\u201d that are widely accepted and publicly available, says Dr. Happer.\n\n\u201cThis is something anybody with a calculator can figure out,\u201d said the scientist, who may be best known for his contribution to a laser-based technology for destroying incoming ballistic missiles as part of the so-called Star Wars program of the 1980s.\n\nThe data needed for the math are the number of years until 2050, the amount of carbon dioxide being added to the atmosphere, which scientists regularly measure, and the current concentration of atmospheric CO2, which is approximately 427 parts per million as of June 2024.\n\nThe only assumed datapoint is the sensitivity of the atmosphere to CO2 increases. The paper uses a value almost the same as one commonly used \u201cbefore global-warming alarmism became fashionable.\u201d Even if the value is quadrupled to a number favored by the politically driven Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the amount of warming averted still is only 0.034 degrees Celsius.\n\nSo, what if the entire world eliminated carbon dioxide emissions from the activities of mankind? Since U.S. emissions account for 12% of global output, the answer lies in the math to determine the remaining 88%. The paper\u2019s calculation is that the amount of warming averted would be 0.07 degrees Celsius. Using the higher IPCC sensitivity value, the number quadruples to 0.28 degrees Celsius. Both are still inconsequential and certainly not worth destroying the world economy.\n\nNoting that others using different approaches have come to conclusions similar to the paper\u2019s, Dr. Happer said he and his coauthors wanted to show that the controversial subject of climate change need not be complicated.\n\n\u201cMore members of the public should understand that they are being victimized by false information disseminated by those whose interests have more to do with money and power than with environmental concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cAnswers found in relatively simple mathematics strongly suggest this to be the case.\u201d\n\nWhatever the motivations, spending trillions of dollars to replace fossil fuels with expensive and unreliable wind and solar sources is foolish, futile and dangerous.",
