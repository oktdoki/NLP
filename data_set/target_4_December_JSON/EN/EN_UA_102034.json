China considers Taiwan a renegade province and has asserted its intention to reunite it with the mainland, even if force is necessary.\n\nWhile the US does not officially recognise Taiwan as an independent country and adheres to a one-China policy, the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 legally binds Washington to \u201cprovide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character\u201d and maintain the capacity to resist any form of coercion.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has reiterated the US commitment to intervene militarily should China use force against Taiwan.\n\nThe survey also indicated strong support for American arms sales to Taiwan, with over 65 per cent of respondents expressing approval. Approximately 57 per cent believed that the US would use force to assist Taiwan if Beijing attempted to unilaterally change the status quo.\n\nThe findings highlight a notable gap between the overall credibility of the US and the credibility of its security commitment to Taiwan. Analysts emphasise that more people are willing to assign credibility to the US security commitment to Taiwan than to the US overall.\n\nRegarding the question of whether Taiwan and China belong to the same country, about 78 per cent of those polled rejected this idea.\n\nNotably, more than 50 per cent of Kuomintang party members or supporters, who generally favor closer ties with Beijing, also asserted that Taiwan and China are not part of the same country. This suggests a disconnect between the KMT party stance and the beliefs of its support base.\n\nAs Taiwan approaches its presidential election scheduled for January 13, the political landscape is becoming increasingly complex.\n\nThe election is expected to focus on local health and welfare issues, as well as relations with Beijing and the island\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nWith regional tensions rising, the outcome of the election is seen as a potential turning point for the island\u2019s future relations with China and the United States. The winning party will play a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of these relationships amidst evolving geopolitical challenges.\n\nWith inputs from agencies",
