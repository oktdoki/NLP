He denies any intention of invasion.\n\nAny U.S. and European measures against Russia in the event of an invasion \u201calso have consequences for others, including us,\u201d Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in remarks as part of a lecture series Monday night.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cost imposed on everyone,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cBut we have done a tremendous amount of work to mitigate any effects of sanctions on those ... imposing them, as well as any retaliatory action that Russia might take.\u201d\n\nTwo senior U.S. administration officials separately briefed reporters Tuesday about efforts by Biden\u2019s national security team to deal with any knock-on effects from sanctions. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deliberations.\n\nWestern embassies are also moving some of their staff out of Kyiv\n\nIf needed, Europe would look to natural gas supplies in North Africa, the Middle East, Asia and the United States. The effort would require \u201crather smaller volumes from a multitude of sources\u201d to make up for a Russian cutoff, according to one of the officials.\n\nThe Biden administration has acknowledged that Russian President Vladimir Putin has high tolerance for the damage to Russia\u2019s economy that would come with sanctions. But officials said the \u201cstart high, stay high\u201d approach to penalties that they have told Moscow they would take could influence Putin\u2019s calculations.\n\nOne official said sanctions could spur inflation in Russia \u201cin the mid-teens\u201d and even, according to the second official, a deep recession that would not help Putin \u201cwin hearts and minds\u201d among his compatriots.\n\nIn the U.S., a group representing large industrial energy users and manufacturers that oppose export of U.S. natural gas appeared open to considering an exception for helping Europeans weather any possible cutoff of Russian natural gas.\n\nUkraine\u2019s leaders are seeking to reassure their jittery citizens that an invasion from neighboring Russia is not imminent, despite a troop buildup.\n\nThe group, Industrial Energy Consumers of America, has asked Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to limit exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Surging U.S. exports have helped drive up natural gas prices, the group argues.\n\nPaul Cicio, the group\u2019s president, told reporters on Tuesday that his group had not taken a position on how the U.S. should respond to tensions between Russia and Europe over natural gas.\n\n\u201cMy own personal view is that if Europe needs gas, the U.S. should be there to supply our allies,\u2033 Cicio said, noting that China is the top recipient of U.S. gas exports.\n\n\u201cDo we have capacity to supply our allies? Absolutely,\u2033 Cicio said. \u201cBut maybe we don\u2019t have capacity to ship to China. So we need to be sensitive to the political crisis. It\u2019s a real serious thing.\u201d",
