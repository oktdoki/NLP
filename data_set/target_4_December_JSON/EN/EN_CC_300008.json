But that was before they were blasting four days a week and everything else,\u201d she says from her family\u2019s property, 7km from Whitehaven Coal\u2019s Maules Creek Mine.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t have a vegetable garden any more because there\u2019s so much fallout from when they blast that it covers all the vegetables, the grass, everything.\u201d\n\nIndoors, it\u2019s more of the same, with coal dust \u201ceverywhere\u201d and constant worry about what years of exposure might be doing to her health.\n\nBut hope is on the horizon \u2013 a Land and Environment Court challenge due to begin on Tuesday.\n\nMs Druce and other members of the Maules Creek Community Council are contesting the Environment Protection Authority\u2019s 2023 review of the mine\u2019s environmental protection licence.\n\nThey will argue the watchdog failed to protect environmental and human health, and did not consider \u201crelevant\u201d pollutants, namely fine-particle pollution and methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas.\n\nSpecifically the case will deal with PM2.5 \u2013 pollution particles so small they can get deep into the lungs and into the bloodstream.\n\nProlonged exposure can cause respiratory and cardiovascular disease and shorten lives.\n\nThe Environmental Defenders Office is representing the community group and will argue the watchdog did not satisfy a legal requirement to consider relevant pollutants and measures that could reduce that pollution when it renewed the mine\u2019s licence in 2023.\n\nIf the community group wins, the EPA would have to carry out a fresh review that considers the impact of all the harmful pollutants, and what could be done to reduce impacts.\n\nMs Druce says she\u2019s hoping for a \u201clandmark win\u201d that will help anyone who might be in her position.\n\n",
