However, there is another viewpoint.\n\nEconomic observers have long known that there are no free lunches, and perhaps it\u2019s time that electric-car fans did as well.\n\nLeftists extol Teslas and other electric cars as cure-alls for fossil fuels\u2019 woes \u2013 even when it comes to something as simple as their tires \u2013 but disregard the tremendous environmental damage these vehicles cause.\n\nBrad Templeton, a Forbes contributor, related a story of his electric car tearing through pricey tires at breakneck speed.\n\nDespite praising the many advantages of electric vehicles over traditional internal combustion engines, Templeton admitted that the requirement for tire replacement at short intervals is an inconvenient downside.\n\n\u201cThe doozy was needing new tires at around 28,000 miles,\u201d Temple writes in \u201cElectric Vehicle Maintenance Is Super-Cheap, But The Dark Secret Is Tires\u201d from last month.\n\n\u201cThat was too early, far before their rated life.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne reason for this was a stupid mistake on my part. In the past, I\u2019ve taken my gasoline cars in for regular service, and they were rotating my tires as needed during this service. Not taking my EV in for service, I never got the rotation done. That not only meant the drive tires of my car wore out faster, it also meant I could not make a warranty claim on them. Lesson learned.\u201d\n\nElectric vehicles do incur charges for what is classified as a repair rather than maintenance. Many Tesla 12v batteries have been reported to fail, albeit most are still under warranty. If you chip a windshield, bang a mirror, or get a car burglary, parts for premium cars are always pricey. He admits that neglecting to rotate the tires properly may have been his fault, but he contends that the added weight of his electric car, along with the necessity for high-efficiency, low-noise tires, meant an expensive purchase was always on the horizon. Apart from that, he characterizes the advantages of owning an electric vehicle as a world of guilt-free driving.\n\nLike Pete Buttigieg, who urged average Americans to buy electric cars to avoid high gas costs while ignoring the $56,000 price tag, which has already proven to be a money trap.\n\nNonetheless, in light of this revelation, it appears that the tradeoff of electric vehicles \u2013 fewer environmental impacts for a higher price \u2013 is having the opposite effect.\n\nRegular tread replacement will have an impact on the environment, both because of the fossil fuels required to manufacture them and because wear and tear contribute more harmful microplastics to the environment.\n\nGiven that modern tires contain petroleum-based plastics, a car tire requires between 7 and 22 gallons of oil to manufacture, according to a National Geographic article.\n\nSomehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are \u201cgreen\u201d? \ud83e\udd14 pic.twitter.com/iahDDqZRls\n\n\u2014 Patrick De Haan \u26fd\ufe0f\ud83d\udcca (@GasBuddyGuy) November 11, 2021\n\nMicroplastics become embedded in shrimp gills and guts, according to a study conducted by John Weinstein, a professor of physiology at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n\u201cSomehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel, and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are \u201cgreen?\u201d Author Patrick De Haan wrote of the deadly bargain greenies have made with batteries made from land-scarred processes.\n\nWhile proponents of electric vehicles argue that they are better for the environment, it is important to remember that there is no such thing as a free lunch, and environmental costs are rising faster than ever before.\n",
