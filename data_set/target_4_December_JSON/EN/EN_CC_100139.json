During the visit, the senior church leader held various interactions with faith leaders and community members. He also visited Jaranwala to express solidarity with the victims of the August 16, 2023, violent attacks on multiple churches and homes of Christians.\n\nSpeaking to a gathering of interfaith leaders at the Saint Peter\u2019s High School of the Diocese of Raiwand, Archbishop Ernest noted the cordial relations between the clergy of the majority Muslim community and leaders of other faiths. He stressed on the need for continued engagement between the various faith groups for promoting harmony and peaceful coexistence in society.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see such good interfaith relations, which can also contribute greatly towards our common goal of protecting our environment,\u201d said Archbishop Ernest.\n\nThe visiting dignitary was awarded a shield by Muslim faith leaders, including former special assistant to the prime minister on interfaith harmony Hafiz Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi.\n\nThe archbishop also participated in a special meeting on climate action organised by the moderator bishop of the Church of Pakistan on Feb 4.\n\nAddressing the participants, Archbishop Ernest lauded the Church of Pakistan\u2019s initiative on climate action, saying he was impressed by the realisation in the church for collaborating with ecumenical partners and faith-based institutions to bring about the much-needed change by raising awareness and collective action.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a God given opportunity for us to be able to change the mentality of our people and to bring about the values of the Kingdom where respect for God\u2019s creation and respect for the other are of crucial importance. Without respecting what God has given us so freely, it would be difficult for us to be instruments of grace in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Bishop Marshall briefed the meeting about the church\u2019s initiatives for fostering partnerships to meet the environmental challenges.\n\nHe stressed on inculcating the spirit of stewardship, as embodied by the wisdom of the Christian tradition, to change the mindset towards the natural world.\n\n\u201cThough Pakistan is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, it is unfortunate that our country is also the least funded to effectively combat the crisis.\n\n\u201cWe need to act together to protect, restore and safeguard the environment for ourselves and for our future generations,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nArchbishop Ernest and bishops of all dioceses of the Church of Pakistan also participated in the soft-launch of Bishop Marshall\u2019s book titled \u201cThe Calling of Lent\u201d at the Lahore College of Theology.\n\nThe messages of Archbishop of Canterbury Rt Revd Justin Welby and Anglican Communion\u2019s Secretary General Rt Revd Bishop Anthony Poggo were also shared on the occasion.\n\nIn his message, Archbishop Welby said, \u201cArchbishop Azad has taken considerable care to explore some of the spiritual disciplines which might help people journey more closely with Christ to the Cross and prepare for the celebrations of Easter.\u201d\n\nBishop Poggo, who has written the foreword of the book, stated: \u201cAs you study this book during Lent, do please reflect upon the passion of Jesus. Lent is also a season whereby we acknowledge our need for repentance, mercy and forgiveness which is the essence of the message of Jesus Christ\u2019s suffering on the cross.\u201d",
