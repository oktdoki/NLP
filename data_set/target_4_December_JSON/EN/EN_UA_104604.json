But moments like this show the growing dangers to independent journalists around the world.\n\n\"These dangers don't stem just from murderous dictators, but also from having journalists' voices hushed - instead of amplified - by the civilised world they are trying to serve.\"\n\nMost read in The Sun\n\nIn response to Grozev's online remarks, Met Police said that police forces generally \"do not and cannot\" ban individuals from attending events, and the decision will rest with the show's organisers.\n\nDespite hand-wringing about \"hostile intentions of foreign states\" in the UK, Met Police said it could not comment on an individual's safety.\n\nA statement read: \"We cannot comment on the safety of an individual or the advice they may have been given.\n\n\"However, the situation that journalists face around the world and the fact that some journalists face the hostile intentions of foreign states whilst in the UK is a reality that we are absolutely concerned with.\n\n\"We are committed to working with our intelligence partners to investigate these threats and to take other steps to ensure the safety of those concerned.\"\n\nThe Met added: \"Despite our efforts, on protective security and on investigations, we recognise the impact of those threats on those affected.\n\n\"The responsibility for such threats and their potential impact on the wider public lies with the hostile state actors behind them and we have significantly increased the resources applied to bearing down on those.\n\n\"More generally, police do not and cannot ban anyone from attending a private event. Decisions about the attendance at an event is a matter for the event organisers.\n\n\"We recognise that our advice can mean organisers have difficult choices to make when deciding how best to mitigate any risks to the security of their event, and we are grateful for the ongoing engagement of Bafta.\"\n\nChristo Grozev is the lead Russia investigator for investigative group Bellingcat.\n\nThe Netherlands-based outfit's work focuses on \u201csecurity threats, extraterritorial clandestine operations, and the weaponization of information,\u201d according to their website.\n\nResponding to Grozev's Twitter thread, Tory MP and chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Alicia Kearns responded: \"I've raised with ministers - you are not the security risk.\"\n\nIn a statement given to the PA news agency regarding security at Sunday's ceremony, Bafta said: \"The safety of all our guests and staff at the ceremony is always our highest priority, and we have robust and appropriate security arrangements in place every year.\"\n\nBafta also confirmed that the film's producers Diane Becker, Shane Boris, Melanie Miller and Odessa Rae will be in attendance as nominees for Navalny.\n\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\n\nGrozev's attendance is yet to be confirmed.\n\nThe Bafta awards ceremony is set to take place at London's Southbank Centre on Sunday.",
