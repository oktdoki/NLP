    "text": "Ukraine: Western Military Backers Are \u201cFed Up\u201d With Supporting Ukraine\u2019s War \n\n\nThe West is increasingly losing patience with supporting Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in the war with Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has claimed that the West is \u201cfed up\u201d with the money pit that has become this war.\n\nPlus, the U.S. has now gotten itself involved in another war between Israel and Palestine, which has the potential to advance to World War 3. Speaking at a meeting with Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, Lavrov argued that \u201ceveryone is fed up\u201d with Zelensky, the Russia 1 TV channel reported on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the broadcaster, the diplomat quoted Romanian Senator Diana Sosoaca, who directed an angry tirade at the Ukrainian president ahead of his visit to Bucharest last week. We all know that this war is a proxy war between Russia and the U.S., so there\u2019s no way the rulers are going to stop financially backing Ukraine.\n\nSosoaca called on Romanian President Klaus Iohannis to prevent Zelensky, whom she described as an \u201carrogant and unconscionable traitor, including to his own country,\u201d from addressing the Romanian parliament. The politician further warned of \u201cbad\u201d consequences should she \u201ccatch\u201d the Ukrainian president at the parliament building. \u201cWe are going to war for Zelensky\u2019s grain! March out of our country, godless man! If you think we will sit idly by, you are wrong!\u201d Sosoaca stated.\n\nStop The Denial: Ukraine Is A Proxy War That Will Lead To Wider World War\n\nAccording to Romanian media, the Ukrainian leader\u2019s planned speech to parliament was canceled during his visit last Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference alongside Johannis, Zelensky insisted that he had never intended to make an address.\n\nThe opinion of Kiev in Romania has been adversely affected by the recent inflow of cheap Ukrainian grain into the country, coupled with what some see as discriminatory treatment toward the Romanian ethnic minority in Ukraine. \u2013RT\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank meetings in Marrakech on Saturday, Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergey Marchenko admitted that Kiev is being forced to make \u201ctwice the effort right now to convince our partners to provide us with support compared to the last annual meetings [in spring].\u201d Part of that is because the U.S. has found another war to support, and one involving religion will be easier to escalate.",
