But Tennis Australia suspended that policy for the two countries involved in the invasion of Ukraine that began nearly a year ago.\n\n\u201cOur initial policy was that fans could bring [flags] in but could not use them to cause disruption,\u201d Tennis Australia said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cYesterday we had an incident where a flag was placed courtside. We will continue to work with the players and our fans to ensure that this is the best possible environment to enjoy the tennis.\u201d\n\nOne Russian flag was displayed during Ukrainian player Kateryna Baindl\u2019s 7-5, 6-7 (8), 6-1 victory over Russian player Kamilla Rakhimova on Court 14 in the first round Monday.\n\nAnother was offered to Russian player Daniil Medvedev to autograph after his 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 win over Marcos Giron in Rod Laver Arena on Monday night.\n\nAsked about the new flag ban, Belarusian player Aryna Sabalenka said after her first-round victory Tuesday that she would prefer that politics and sports remain separate but that she understands the decision by Tennis Australia.\n\nJessica Pegula and Coco Gauff each pick up wins in the first round of the Australian Open as they begin their quest for a first Grand Slam title.\n\n\u201cI mean, if everyone feels better this way, then it\u2019s OK,\u201d said Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam semifinalist who is seeded No. 5 at Melbourne Park. \u201cI have zero control on it. What can I say? They did it. OK. No flags? No flags.\u201d\n\nSabalenka was among the athletes from Russia and Belarus who were barred last year from competing at Wimbledon and team events such as the Billie Jean King Cup and Davis Cup because of the war in Ukraine. Russia invaded, with help from Belarus, in February.\n\nRussian and Belarusian players have been allowed to enter the other three Grand Slam tournaments but as \u201cneutral\u201d athletes, so their nationalities are not acknowledged on any official schedules or results for the event and their countries\u2019 flags are not displayed on TV graphics.",
