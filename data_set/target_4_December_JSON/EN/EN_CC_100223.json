The message of the Paris Pact for People and the Planet is that we must all take our part to allow each country to alleviate poverty and tackle climate change,\u201d said France\u2019s Minister of State for Development and International Partnerships, Chrysoula Zacharopoulou. \u201cThis includes states, which must support development policies with sufficient resources. For this reason, I am particularly pleased to announce, on behalf of France and President Macron, the allocation of \u20ac40 million to support ECW\u2019s actions for the 2023-2026 cycle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith this new bold and generous contribution, France shines as an example for others to follow,\u201d said ECW Executive Director Yasmine Sherif. \u201cWe call on government donors, philanthropic foundations, and the private sector to follow suit and join our collective efforts to mobilize a total of US$1.5 billion by 2026 to provide quality education to 20 million crisis-affected girls and boys so they can learn, grow and rebuild their societies.\u201d\n\nGlobally, around 224 million children are deprived of a quality education due to armed conflicts, forced displacement, climate-induced disasters and other protracted crises. They need urgent support to fulfil their right to a quality, inclusive education.\n\nTogether with strategic partners, ECW has already reached close to 9 million girls and boys in some of the harshest crises around the globe.\n\nWhile donors are stepping up, the funding gap has actually widened in recent years. Humanitarian appeals for education in emergencies have nearly tripled from US$1.1 billion in 2019 to almost US$3 billion at the end of 2022.\n",
