Watch:\n\nEarlier this year, Gates flew around Australia on board his $70 million dollar luxury private jet lecturing people about climate change and ordering them to stop flying on planes.\n\nGates, who has declared that the energy crisis is a good thing, owns no fewer than FOUR private jets at a combined cost of $194 million dollars.\n\nA study carried out by Linnaeus University economics professor Stefan G\u00f6ssling found that Gates flew more than 213,000 miles on 59 private jet flights in 2017 alone.\n\nGates emitted an estimated 1,760 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, over a hundred times more than the emissions per capita in the United States, according to data from the World Bank.\n\nElsewhere during the carefully constructed interview, Gates said he was surprised that he was targeted by \u2018conspiracy theorists\u2019 for pushing vaccines during the pandemic.\n\nWhile the BBC interview was set up to look like Gates was being challenged or grilled, he wasn\u2019t asked about his close friendship with the elite pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.",
