If Putin is allowed to \u201ctake\u201d Ukraine, what is to convince him, then, that \u201ctaking\u201d Poland is not equally attainable?\n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t like any of the alternatives. I think limited, conventional warfare is in order, utilizing lots of conventional high-tech weaponry. The war should not be escalated beyond that, even if Russia uses chemical or biological weapons.\n\nIf the Kraken is already released, what choice do we have but to confront it?\n\nDenys Arcuri, Indio\n\n..\n\nTo the editor: Letter writers advocating escalating use of force by the U.S. and NATO in Ukraine illustrate how Euro-centric and frankly white-centric our global views are.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine is horrific and needs to be addressed forcefully by the U.S. and its allies. But why should the U.S. and NATO engage in armed conflict in the latest global tragedy while ignoring or being responsible for much larger humanitarian disasters of the past few decades, which resulted in much higher fatalities?\n\nLike the invasion of Ukraine, these humanitarian disasters unleashed unthinkable death and destruction on innocent people. Unlike the invasion of Ukraine, they took place in nonwhite and non-European locations.\n\nFew Americans advocated for a global power to intercede and put an end to their suffering.\n\nCarl Godlewski, Venice",
