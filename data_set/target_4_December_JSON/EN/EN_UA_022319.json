I suspect we all know the answer. It\u2019s likely to grow,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Shapps also announced 20,000 British service personnel would take part in NATO\u2019s largest military exercises since the Cold War, following the announcement last week of a \u00a32.5 billion support package to Ukraine.\n\nOver the weekend the RAF carried out air strikes with U.S. forces on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, after they targeted merchant shipping in their campaign against Israel.\n\nThe British government has set a goal of increasing defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP, but Mr. Shapps has argued it should rise to 3 percent.\n\nHis speech on Monday\u2014in front of an audience including top brass in the British military\u2014might be seen as pushing the argument for increased defence spending.\n\nMr. Shapps said, \u201cWe made the critical decision to set out our aspiration to reach 2.5 percent of GDP on defence, and as we stabilise and grow this economy we\u2019ll continue to strive to reach that as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut now is the time for all allied and democratic nations across the world to do the same thing and ensure their defence spending is growing too,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2018The Tanks Are Literally on Europe\u2019s Ukrainian Lawn\u2019The defence secretary said: \u201cAn age of idealism has been replaced by a period of hard-headed realism. Today our adversaries are busy rebuilding their barriers, old enemies are reanimated, new foes are taking shape, battle lines are being redrawn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tanks are literally on Europe\u2019s Ukrainian lawn and the foundations of the world order being shaken to their core,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Shapps refused to rule out further action against the Houthis following the weekend attacks.\n\nHe said the strike against the Houthis was a \u201csingle action\u201d but added, \u201cWe will now monitor very carefully to see what they do next, how they respond and we will see from there.\u201d\n\nLater Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he would \u201cnot hesitate\u201d to protect British shipping in the Red Sea.\n\nMr. Sunak told Sky News, \u201cAs we\u2019ve said, not just to the Houthis but to their Iranian masters, in a sense, because they are really proxies for Tehran, this cannot go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cFreedom of navigation is just a given and always has been for many years. We cannot have that situation where they are trying to harass it, and we will keep a very close eye. If we have to take further action, that is something that we will consider,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added, \u201cThey should be aware that if it doesn\u2019t stop then of course we will then have to take the decisions that need to be taken.\u201d",
