Healthcare information once hacked is not reversible.\n\n\u201cSimply changing someone\u2019s birthday is enough to disrupt the entire US online health system and fixing it would be very, very difficult.\u201d\n\nThe expert said that a potential cyberattack on institutions would be \u201cmore crippling\u201d than a terrorist attack.\n\nShe added: \u201c9/11 was a shock event. It was traumatic as we had never seen anything like it before.\n\nMost read in Tech\n\n\u201cBut, the real disruption to people, companies, and systems of governance is going to be a cyberattack.\u201d\n\nIn June 2017, the Health Care Industry Cybersecurity Task Force warned in a report that healthcare cybersecurity is in a \u201ccritical condition\u201d.\n\nThe dossier stated: \u201cHealthcare cybersecurity is a key public health concern that needs immediate and aggressive attention.\u201d\n\nResearchers at the computer hardware company IBM say that healthcare firms on average take around 236 days to detect a data breach, and 93 days to mitigate the damage.\n\nThis compares to the average of 207 days to identify and 73 days to contain a cyberattack.\n\n'EASY TARGETS'\n\nAnd, US hospitals have around 10-15 networked medical devices per bed on average, meaning officials are working to secure machinery that\u2019s easy to breach, according to Wired.\n\nAnalysts at the Brookings Institute believe \u201cthe fate of healthcare security\u201d depends on whether investments in cybersecurity are made.\n\nThey said: \u201cJust as a responsible healthcare professional seeks to identify and treat patients\u2019 underlying chronic conditions before they cause a serious medical emergency, so too must responsible healthcare organizations address vulnerabilities in their digital infrastructure to prevent cyberattacks.\"\n\nFears of a potential cyberattack on US institutions are rising amid the crisis in Ukraine.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials warned that the US is on \u201cheightened alert\u201d for a potential cyberattack from Moscow.\n\nRehman believes an attack on the US is \"highly likely\" should the crisis in Eastern Europe escalate.\n\nPentagon officials warned Friday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would result in a \"horrific\" aftermath.\n\nMoscow has amassed around 100,000 troops at the Ukrainian border - something which Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he hadn't seen in the past four decades.\n\nRehman said: \u201cA US response would probably set off what we believe will be the world\u2019s first large-scale cyberwar.\n\nUS IN 'WARFARE STATE'\n\n\u201cThe Russians have been doing cyber-espionage and pre-positioning operations \u2013 meaning they\u2019re setting up vulnerabilities in our infrastructure which means when they\u2019re ready, they can release. It might not necessarily be tomorrow.\u201d\n\nR.P. Eddy, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Ergo, warned that the US is already in a \u201cwarfare state\u201d with Moscow, Fox News reports.\n\nHe told governors: \u201cWhat\u2019s Russia\u2019s next move? [It\u2019s] very likely is to increase cyberattacks. It\u2019s an easy move for them.\n\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\n\n\u201cWe are already in a warfare state right now and we need to be aware of that.\u201d\n\nJen Easterly, Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), warned said officials are taking any \"rippling effects\" of a potential Russian invasion \u201cvery seriously\u201d.\n\nWe pay for your stories!\n\nDo you have a story for The US Sun team?\n\nEmail us at exclusive@the-sun.com or call 212 416 4552.\n\nLike us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/TheSunUS and follow us from our main Twitter account at @TheSunUS",
