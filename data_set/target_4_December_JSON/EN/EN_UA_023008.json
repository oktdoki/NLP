Tucker Carlson interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin last week.\n\nEveryone, even the Davos/UK dominated media, has put forth their opinion on it. I gave out a quick take for my Patrons the morning after just like everyone else. And like everyone else I missed the biggest takeaway from this interview.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nNow, if you go through the commentary what you will mostly see is people, as always, doing what traders call \u201ctalking their book.\u201d In other words, as opposed to dealing with the information presented and the motivations of the people involved, most media outlets and commentators put forth their opinion on whether this interview satisfied their needs from it.\n\nSo, for the hardcore geopolitical types and armchair psychoanalysts, we heard a lot of opinions second-guessing Putin\u2019s strategy to open the interview with a nearly thirty minute recitation of Russian/Ukrainian history. Why would he do this, was the common refrain.\n\nI\u2019ll use my former-bellwether-for-normies, Scott Adams, as an example of this.\n\nHow many of you thought Putin was \u201call there\u201d in the Tucker interview?\n\nIf he seemed lucid to you, it\u2019s because Biden is your comparison.\n\nI thought Putin seemed unhinged. The history lesson was not a good sign. https://t.co/VZiEIHRZ2t\n\n\u2014 Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) February 9, 2024\n\nThis was the kindest of the \u2018bad takes\u2019 I found on this. But I\u2019m having one of Scott\u2019s \u201cOne movie, two screens,\u201d moments here. Because Putin looked anything other than \u201cunhinged.\u201d In fact, he looked as calm as I\u2019ve ever seen him, taking a relaxed posture to put Carlson, who was clearly unsure of where he stood at the beginning of the interview, at ease.\n\nBut this is the message that Adams wanted to see, framing Putin in relation to Biden, because he needed something unique to say to justify his even being in the conversation.\n\nBy contrast, Martin Armstrong had a great post curating all of the crazy Neocon takes from the \u201cmedia\u201d on his blog over the weekend.\n\nWhat\u2019s obvious from those is that they understood that Putin\u2019s 30 minute opening monologue would put off a lot of casual watchers who would tune him out at that point. So, their \u201canalysis\u201d focused on steering the conversation to Putin\u2019s \u2018false history\u2019 of Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThis way that \u2018false history\u2019 would dominate everyone\u2019s opinions the next day, managing the Overton Window of the entire interview, making it all about that. This would be the basis of how they discredit Putin.\n\nThen to discredit Carlson, people like Hillary Clinton was trotted out to lie about Tucker Carlson, calling him a \u201cuseful idiot,\u201d and \u201cpuppy dog\u201d and a joke in Russian media, which is an outright lie. Hillary\u2019s harpy laugh made an appearance alongside a sycophant interviewer as they joked about Carlson\u2019s having been fired from every legitimate news agency.\n\nWe were treated to a common sight: Two Beltway insiders laughing inside their echo chamber and only our sick fascination with roadkill makes it even remotely interesting.\n\nSo, the whole exercise is reframed as Puppy Dog Tucker throwing softballs to Liar Putin to distract us away from the sum and substance of their talk.\n\nI know\u2026 in other news water is wet and women want more sex when they\u2019re fertile.",
