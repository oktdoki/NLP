    "text": "Climate Expert: \u2018Three Strikes\u2019 Against Climate Alarmism \n\n Facts and data show \u201cthree strikes and climate alarmism should be out,\u201d climate truth-teller Steve Milloy told PJ Media. \u201cBut it\u2019s still at bat and swinging,\u201d propped up by the \u201cfake news media.\u201d\n\nJunk Science\u2019s Milloy explained the three biggest truths undermining the mainstream narrative in exclusive comments to PJ Media. [emphasis, links added]\n\n\u201cWe are 35 years into climate alarmism, and we\u2019ve had no global warming since 2015 despite 450 billion tons of emissions; no type of natural disaster correlates with emissions or warming; and no apocalyptic climate prediction has ever come true,\u201d Milloy stated.\n\nIt\u2019s time to admit the fraud.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s three strikes and climate alarmism should be out. But it\u2019s still at bat and swinging because the fake news media shares its leftist agenda and will not call it out,\u201d Milloy added.\n\nAfter all, governments can use climate change as a convenient excuse for increasing their power and control.\n\nMilloy\u2019s comments followed the publication of a new report.\n\nThe Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), The Heartland Institute, the Energy & Environmental (E&E) Legal Institute, the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, the International Climate Science Coalition, and Truth in Energy and Climate issued their \u201cClimate Fact Check: September 2023 Edition.\u201d Milloy posted the report at ClimateRealism.com.\n\nThe first myth the groups attacked was the media apocalypse prophesying on \u201cglobal warming.\u201d They looked at data to determine if September did have record heat.\n\nBased on NASA satellite data, September 2023 had the highest temperature anomaly (i.e., difference from average) on record. It was 0.9C warmer than the 1991-2020 average.\n\nIn contrast, the Temperature.global compilation of actual temperature measurements from surface stations has September only slightly warmer than the average monthly temperature of the past 8 years and 9 months, and far from the warmest month since January 2015.\n\nWhich data is more accurate and reliable? \u201cNASA admits the surface stations are. There has still been no global warming since January 2015,\u201d the report insisted. [That\u2019s \u201cbecause they directly measure the temperature where people reside\u201d]\n\nIt also stated that \u201caverage global temperature\u201d is \u201cnot an actual physical metric,\u201d but merely a \u201cflawed notion\u201d used to fuel climate alarmism.\n\nThe report analyzed and fact-checked multiple media claims about the past month\u2019s weather. Did the huge downpour in New York City break records and was it due to climate change?\n\nNo, the groups said, citing the New York Times\u2019s records to disprove the claims.\n\nAs The New York Times asserted, is rainfall across the country becoming \u201cmore fearsome\u201d due to global warming? The problem with that claim is that warmer air doesn\u2019t cause \u201cmore intense rainfall,\u201d the groups explained.\n\nAre Alpine glaciers melting at a concerning rate? Perhaps, but it\u2019s not because of man-made \u201cemissions;\u201d the report noted that the Alps were free of ice thousands of years ago, and the current receding has been ongoing for years, before modern industrial society.\n\nThe report further fact-checked claims around hurricanes, Antarctic ice, emissions and the \u201chottest summer\u201d propaganda, Norwegian glaciers, and allegedly human-driven global warming.\n\nIt ends by providing context to an analysis supposedly proving man-driven global warming. If you add in the warming caused by \u201cthe series of El Ni\u00f1os,\u201d it\u2019s highly questionable that fossil fuels have warmed Earth \u201cto any discernible extent.\u201d\n\nIn fact, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data showed earlier this year that there hadn\u2019t been global warming for eight years.\n\nThe \u201cclimate crisis\u201d is an unscientific political crock.\n",
