Answer: WWIII.\nYou might not know it.\nBut Russia does.\nThat’s why it is delaying its offensive in Ukraine.\nTo give it time to prepare for the worst.\nIt could easily overun Ukraine and end the war in its favour but that will result in all out war from the West.\nThat’s the only explanation.\n\nThe evil empire wants the phoenix from the ashes.\nThey know, or they at least think they will be the only ones capable of taking power once it is all over.\nThey do not care about human life except their own.\nThey have the means to exterminate all life on earth and that is what they will do to aquire the god status promised them by their god.\nThey have no reason to disbelieve him.\n\nLook at the power and wealth they already have. It was promised them and he delivered. What more needs to be said.\nThey forget they are still of this world and once they die all bets are off.\nEvil = stupid.\nSatan himself is evil therefore stupid.\nIt’s a case of the blind deceiving the blind.\n\nNone of it matters to us.\nNot as long as we are not sucked into the evil which is what they are trying to do through the mass media, normalising evil, presenting it as the only available option.\nThis takes many forms and part of it is to force you to accept knowing lies so that you become a willing subservient slave of the lie, a willing, knowing slave of the lie. A laughable person, by any standard.\nWith all this going on is it any wonder the Bible says people will all be microchipped willingly.\nAll but the few.\nThis is troublesome\n\nThe few will be guillotined but is it possible many more will be raptured away beforehand?\nThere are indications of this in the Bible.\nThe fire and thunder preachers of the past, the righteous ones, it is clear, we’re right after all, from current events where it will take all our efforts in that regard to avoid eternal hellfire.\n",
