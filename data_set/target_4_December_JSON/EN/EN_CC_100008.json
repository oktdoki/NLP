This is why they did it. \n\n A group of UK-based climate activists, called the Tyre Extinguishers, is moving around deflating the tyres of parked SUVs (sports utility vehicles) on roads in an effort to combat global warming.\n\nThe group has claimed credit for tyre-deflating operations in American cities including New York City, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, and cities in England, Canada, France, Spain, Germany and Italy among others, according to a report by Fox News.\n\n\u201cReports coming in of very angry #CarShaggers who are upset they can\u2019t drive their massive tanks around Lisbon. Oh no! Welcome to the fun, Portugal! We will make SUVs history,\u201d the group posted on Twitter along with an image of a Portuguese-language pamphlet the activists left on one of the targeted SUVs.\n\nOn their own website, the \u201cTyre Extinguishers\u201d who believe in guerilla climate activism explain why they are protesting against SUVs. The group\u2019s website has details and instructions on how to quickly deflate tires on parked cars. It also has a template for pamphlets that activists can use during their operations. Once the person deflates the tyres, they leave a document with a headline stating, \u201cATTENTION - your gas guzzler kills,\u201d on the vehicle\u2019s windshield explaining to its owner why such action was taken.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be angry, but don\u2019t take it personally. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s your car. We did this because driving around in urban areas in your massive vehicle has huge consequences for others,\u201d the pamphlet reads.\n\nNEW: FIRST ACTION IN PORTUGAL! LISBON SUVS DISARMED \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf9\u2014 The Tyre Extinguishers (@T_Extinguishers) June 1, 2023\n\nReports coming in of very angry #CarShaggers who are upset they can't drive their massive tanks around Lisbon. Oh no! Welcome to the fun, Portugal!\n\nWe will make SUVs history.

We do this with a simple tactic: Deflating the tyres of these massive, unnecessary vehicles, causing inconvenience for their owners,\u201d the website points out.\n\nTyre Extinguishers is a \u201cleaderless, autonomous movement of groups that act independently,\u201d according to their website.\n\n\u201cSUVs and 4x4s are a disaster for our health, our public safety, and our climate. Bigger and bigger cars are dominating our towns and cities, all so a privileged few can flaunt their wealth. Because governments and politicians have failed to protect us from this danger, we must protect ourselves. We want to make it impossible to own a huge polluting 4x4 in the world\u2019s urban areas. We do this by deflating the tyres of these massive, unnecessary vehicles, causing inconvenience and expense for their owners,\u201d says the website of the organisation.\n",
