This is what Joachim Brudzinski, MEP for Poland\u2019s Law and Justice (PiS) party, said following this week\u2019s EP debate on the energy performance of EU buildings.\n\nUwierzy\u0142e\u015b #Koalicja13Grudnia ?

The directive includes a ban on gas boilers by 2025. \u201eIf this is not an example of a particular kind of ecological madness, or even idiocy, then there are other examples of Brussels\u2019s mad ambitions,\u201d the PiS politician said. The directive would also stipulate that all new buildings must be zero emission by 2030. He believes this is ideological madness, best exemplified by the fact that until the war in Ukraine, gas was the so-called \u201eclean energy source\u201d powering Europe\u2019s largest economy. Brudzinski also pointed out that it is clear who controls Brussels and whose will and interests prevail in EU actions.\n\n\u201eAs long as Germany had Nord Stream with Russia, gas was fine. When Nord Stream was stopped, suddenly the Germans realised that gas was fossil energy and they were already saying we should move away from gas. And what should we switch to? Heat pumps. Where will these pumps be manufactured? Well, new factories are already mushrooming along the German-Polish border \u2013 in Germany, in fact.\u201d\n\nthe Polish MEP pointed out.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Tzw.

The vice president of the Law and Justice Party explained that no European funding had been provided to implement the directive.\n\nTags:",
