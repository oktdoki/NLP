[bold, links added]\n\n\u2026snip\u2026 In separate \u2013 and far more provocative -comments made earlier in the day during a JPMorgan investor seminar where he led a fireside chat moderated by JPMorgan\u2019s Gergana Thiel, Dimon made some extremely outspoken comments that you won\u2019t hear on the mainstream media, telling a small group of listeners that was closed to the press that the \u201cPresident of the United States needs to stand up and say we may not meet our 2050 climate objectives because this is a fucking war.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201ctime to stop going hat in hand to Venezuela and Saudi and start pumping more oil & gas in the USA.\u201d\n\nEchoing what he has said before, Jamie said this is the way the USA maintains its standing, as the future of the world is by pumping more oil and gas and using energy security to ensure Western unity.\n\nAnd he did say when it comes to ESG that \u201cinvestors don\u2019t give a shit\u201d warning not to \u201ccede governance to do-gooder kids on a committee.\u201d\n\nFinally, he stressed the need for strong American leadership that is not being provided by either party. His conclusion: the world needs American diplomacy and neither Trump nor Biden can lead the USA.\n\nh/t R\u00fanar O.\n\nRead rest at ZeroHedge\n\nJoin our list\n\nSubscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox.\n\nFundamentally, Mr. Dimon is right. Fossil fuels provide 80% of our domestic primary energy with an ongoing evolution that has taken about 120 years to build our modern, reliable & affordable domestic energy system. The \u201cenergy transition\u201d will not be accelerated by government mandate or fiat. It will be dictated by the laws of physics and the energy imperatives of cost, energy/power density, scale & sustainability. So, Joe Biden can madate we will \u201copenly defy gravity by 2050.\u201d That does not mean we can IMPLEMENT it! We\u2019d better get a fully informed, rational and civilzed debate on energy & attendant environmental policy started soon. Otherwise, the average Americans standard of living will continue to head south. Just ask anyone in the EU how the \u201cGreen Dream\u201d is working out. With the current policy course, the U.S is only 2-3 years behind the same DISASTOROUS result\u2026\n\nJamie Dimon speaks the truth and the Democrats don\u2019t like that. Lower energy costs would lower inflation, but that would require new refineries and some backing from Washington that gives the explorers and drillers confidence. ESG is a money loser. Avoid any entity that promotes it.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t have to pay higher prices to gas up our cars and lawnmowers if Biden the Bumbler Had\u2019d canceled the Keystone Pipeline and the ANWR to appease the Eco-Freaks and the Russians/OPEC",
