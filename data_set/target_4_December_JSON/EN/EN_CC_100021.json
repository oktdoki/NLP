In a race to zero emission and resource decoupling, circularity emerges as the \u201cnext normal\u201d linking business and sustainable development. For the BGMEA, circularity sits in the core of our values, mission and vision. Our goal is to help conserve the natural eco-system as much as possible via an economic shift from a linear to circular system, while generating greater social and economic values.\u2019\n\nMark Draeck said, \u2018With the support of the European Union and the government of Finland, UNIDO leads the global Switch to Circular Economy Value Chains project.\u2019\n\n\u2018In Bangladesh, we support the circular transition for the textile and garments industry, by piloting innovative circular solutions in close cooperation with global and national industry leaders, which as BESTSELLER, H&M and their manufacturers,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018These pilots will address acute challenges on new technology, business models and traceability, and will demonstrate the economic opportunity for circular approaches.\n\nThe project also collaborates with government partners, academia, and NGOs to create an enabling environment for circularity through policy and tailored capacity building,\u2019 he added.",
