Yet glaciers were retreating rapidly. Now that the planet allegedly has a fever, the retreat has slowed dramatically and even reversed:\n\nOur moonbat rulers canceled the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age for failing to comply with climate ideology. But preventing glaciers from growing is more difficult than doctoring the historical record to support climate con man Michael Mann\u2019s spurious hockey stick graph.\n\nNonetheless, prophet of doom Al Gore shouts that \u201cwe could lose our capacity for self-governance\u201d if we don\u2019t surrender still more freedom to Big Government so that it can fix the supposedly broken weather.\n\nOn tips from Lyle and Wiggins.\n\nAnyone can join.\n\nAnyone can contribute.\n\nAnyone can become informed about their world.\n\n",
