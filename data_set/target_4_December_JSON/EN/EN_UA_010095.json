Muller did not reveal what the committee was due to discuss and did not offer further comment to Reuters news agency.\n\nThe committee talks, which will include senior members of Poland\u2019s government and its intelligence services, come following unverified reports that stray Russian missiles intended for Ukraine have hit a Polish village, killing two civilians.\n\nAccording to Radio ZET, a Polish commercial radio station, \u201ctwo stray rockets fell in the village of Przewod\u00f3w in the Lublin province near the border with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nRussian authorities have denied that the missiles that struck Poland came from Russia.\n\nThe station further reported that two people had died at the scene. The Polish military, the police, and the prosecutor\u2019s office have been called to the scene.\n\nMilitary planes are also understood to have been scrambled.\n\nPolish authorities are yet to confirm media reports that Russian missiles were responsible for the explosion but they were substantiated by a senior U.S. intelligence official to the Associated Press news agency on Tuesday evening.\n\n\u201cThe causes of this incident are not known at the moment,\u201d said Marcin Lebiedowicz, a spokesman for the Poviat Fire Brigade in Hrubiesz\u00f3w\n\n\u201cWe received a report of an explosion in the drying yard. In fact, upon arrival, we confirm that something like this happened. Two people died on the spot. At the moment, we are securing the scene and lighting the area of the action,\u201d he added.\n\nKurier Lubelski, a regional Polish news outlet from the affected area has attempted numerous times on Tuesday to verify the details with state officials to no avail.\n\nAt 7 p.m. local time, the outlet was told by the local mayor\u2019s office: \u201cI can\u2019t say anything about it. However, there is definitely no need to arouse anxiety. Let\u2019s wait for the exact findings of the services.\u201d\n\nAt 7.30 .p.m. local time, the news outlet attempted to speak again with Marcin Lebiedowicz for further information on the incident.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to give any information at the moment. I suggest contacting other services,\u201d he replied.\n\nThe local police department\u2019s spokesperson has not been available for comment to local media, but Voivode of Lublin Lech Sprawka confirmed he was on his way to the accident site.\n\nCzech Prime Minister Petr Fiala stated that \u201cIf Poland confirms that the missiles also hit its territory, this will be a further escalation by Russia. We stand firmly behind our EU and NATO ally.\u201d\n\nLatvia\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Artis Pabriks stated that the \u201ccriminal Russian regime\u201d had hit Poland with missiles, although it is unclear what evidence he has to back his statement at this time.\n\nLithuanian President Gitanas Naus\u0117da said \u201cevery inch of NATO territory must be defended.\u201d\n\nHungarian government spokesperson, Zolan Kovacs, also confirmed via Twitter that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n had convened an emergency meeting of Hungary\u2019s Defense Council for Tuesday evening \u201cin response to missiles hitting the territory of Poland.\u201d\n\nA U.K. Foreign Office spokesman told Sky News: \u201cWe are investigating these reports and liaising closely with allies.\u201d\n\nRussian military launched a strong aerial assault on Ukraine on Tuesday, targeting key cities including Lviv, just 80 kilometers from the Polish border.\n\nIf reports are accurate, it will be the first time Russian projectiles have reached Poland.",
