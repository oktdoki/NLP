Ukraine\u2019s General Staff acknowledged on Monday that Russia \u201ccurrently is achieving tactical success\u201d after driving a wedge into Kyiv\u2019s defences. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Monday that troops had \u201cimproved the tactical position and dealt a blow to (Ukrainian) manpower\u201d around border villages including Lyptsi and the town of Vovchansk.\n\n\u201cThey are shelling the villages, firing on everything they can,\u201d Sergiy Kryvetchenko, deputy head of the military administration in the village of Lyptsi, told AFP. \u201cThe KABs (guided aerial bombs) are flying. The artillery is flying. Drones. Everything,\u201d he said.On Friday, Russia began an offensive across its border into the Kharkiv region and later claimed to have taken several villages in the region near the border.\n\nThe situation in the Kharkiv region is \u201ccomplex and dynamically changing\u201d, with Russian troops mounting assaults in various areas, Ukraine\u2019s General Staff said. Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov wrote on social media that over the last day, \u201cmore than 30\u201d towns and villages \u201cwere struck by enemy artillery and mortar attacks\u201d, wounding at least nine people.\n\nSome areas were also bombed by Russian aircraft, Synegubov added. A total of 5,762 people have been evacuated from their homes since the start of the offensive, the governor said. Over the course of Sunday, Russia \u201ccarried out 22 assaults\u201d in five border areas, 14 of which were still ongoing, the General Staff said. The General Staff said fighting was ongoing for the border town of Vovchansk, where Russia was deploying \u201csignificant forces\u201d.\n\nnumbering up to five battalions.\n\nVovchansk, which previously had a population of 2,500 but now has only 200-300 residents, suffered \u201cmassive shelling\u201d on Sunday that hit houses and wounded seven, said Synegubov.\n\nA 69-year-old man was also wounded in the town of Izyum by detonating ammunition and a woman was injured in a village near the town of Kupiansk.\n\nThe city of Kharkiv itself had not been struck over the last 24 hours, however, he said.\n\nSynegubov said on national television that \u201cthe grey zone and the front line are expanding\u201d because Russia is \u201ctrying to deliberately stretch it, attacking in small groups in new directions\u201d.\n\nThe DeepState Telegram channel, which is close to the Ukrainian army, wrote that Russia had taken pockets of territory measuring around 100 square kilometres (39 square miles).\n\nRussia \u201ccontinues to advance to Vovchansk\u201d, the channel said.\n\n\u201cThey are gaining foothold on the outskirts for further entry into the town.\u201d\n\nRussia was also advancing towards the border village of Lyptsi and attempting to enter the nearby village of Glyboke, it said.\n\nUkraine was mounting \u201cconstant fire\u201d, including from drones, \u201cbut unfortunately it does not stop them\u201d.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said troops had repelled Ukrainian counterattacks near Glyboke.\n\nRybar, a Russian Telegram channel with military links, said Moscow\u2019s offensive led to territorial gains because troops took some villages where Russian soldiers already had a presence and others that were \u201cdeserted wastelands\u201d.\n\nAs of Monday morning, there were no \u201clarge-scale breakthroughs of the enemy\u2019s defences\u201d, Rybar said.\n\nUkrainian military said Russia was also shelling the Sumy and Chernigiv border regions further west.",
