He added that Ukraine may well have time to do this before the upcoming nuclear inspection.\n\nOver the last few days, Russian officials, including Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, have been accusing Kiev of preparing a false-flag attack with the use of a \u2018dirty bomb\u2019, a device combining conventional explosives with radioactive material. Ukraine has categorically denied Moscow\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cIf you read the Ukrainian Telegram channels, you would see that there is a lot of fuss in the Ukrainian ruling circles now because of the campaign that we have started to launch, and there are many signs that they are trying to sort of wind down this program,\u201d Polyansky said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.\n\nIn his opinion, Ukraine has enough time to scale back the \u2018dirty bomb\u2019 plans before the upcoming visit of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors.\n\n\u201cThey can come, but I am telling you that a \u2018dirty bomb\u2019 is not a very complex device,\u201dPolyansky explained, adding that there is no guarantee that Kiev will not resume its alleged activity after the inspectors depart.\n\nAt the same time, the official claimed that the danger of Kiev using a \u2018dirty bomb\u2019 remains \u201cvery high,\u201d and that Ukraine \u201chas the opportunity\u201d and \u201chas every reason to use it.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the Russian mission\u2019s head, Vassily Nebenzia, said that Moscow would consider the use of a \u2018dirty bomb\u2019 by Ukraine \u201can act of nuclear terrorism.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba earlier called the Russian allegations \u201cas absurd as they are dangerous.\u201d He also noted that \u201cRussians often accuse others of what they plan themselves.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the minister revealed that Ukraine had invited IAEA inspectors to come and to \u201cprove that Ukraine has neither any dirty bombs nor plans to develop them.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood cooperation with IAEA and partners allows us to foil Russia\u2019s \u2018dirty bomb\u2019 disinfo campaign,\u201d Kuleba said.\n\nUN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, commenting on the matter, said that \u201call parties should avoid any actions that could lead to miscalculation and escalation of what\u2019s already a devastating conflict.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon claimed that Russia\u2019s allegations against Ukraine were \u201ctransparently false.\u201d NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said that the allies \u201creject the allegation\u201d and believe that Russia \u201cmust not use it as a pretext\u201d for further escalation.\n\nSource: https://tapnewswire.com/2022/10/russia-exposure-of-dirty-bomb-plans-caused-panic-in-kiev/\n\nAnyone can join.\n\nAnyone can contribute.\n\nAnyone can become informed about their world.\n\n\"United We Stand\" Click Here To Create Your Personal Citizen Journalist Account Today, Be Sure To Invite Your Friends.\n\nHumic & Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex\n\nHerbAnomic\u2019s Humic and Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex is a revolutionary new Humic and Fulvic Acid Complex designed to support your body at the cellular level.
