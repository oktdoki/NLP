James Comer (R-KY).\n\nAccording to Comer, his team has been unable to reach the FBI informant who alleged corruption by Biden and his family, after the bureau dodged a subpoena last week demanding a report detailing allegations that he took bribes while vice president.\n\n\u201cWell, unfortunately, we can\u2019t track down the informant. We\u2019re hopeful that the informant is still there,\u201d Comer told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d Comer also said a whistleblower communicating with the committee about the alleged bribery scheme \u201cknows the informant\u201d and is \u201ccredible.\u201d\n\nThe People\u2019s Voice had the scoop on the missing whistleblower last week. Watch:\n\nComer told Bartiromo that the Oversight Committee has identified a pattern of intimidation by the Biden White House.\n\n\u201cNine of the ten people that we\u2019ve identified that have very good knowledge with respect to the Bidens, they\u2019re one of three things: They\u2019re either currently in court; they\u2019re currently in jail; or they\u2019re currently missing,\u201d said Comer.\n\nHe said others \u201cwant to come forward\u201d about the first family\u2019s history of influence peddling, but they \u201cfear for their lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only are the Biden lawyers and the Biden White House intimidating them \u2014 the media is trying to intimidate and discredit them,\u201d according to Comer, who went on to blast committee Democrats for their actions in the probe.\n\nComer also revealed further details about how the FBI dodged a subpoena demanding details about the corruption case. According to Comer, the whole thing stinks of a high-level cover up.\n\nThe FBI objected to handing over the FD-1023 informant report last week, informing the Oversight panel in a six-page letter that the information was \u201cunverified\u201d and may risk the confidentiality of agency sources.\n\n\u201cAll we\u2019re asking the FBI with respect to the form 1023 is, \u2018What did you do to investigate this allegation?\u2019 And they sent us back a very patronizing letter basically saying, \u2018Just trust us and don\u2019t worry about it,\u2019\u201d Comer said Sunday.\n\n\u201cThis is a pattern of behavior by the FBI that would suggest there\u2019s been a cover-up for many years with respect to the Biden influence-peddling.\u201d\n\nAccording to the subpoena, the report on the allegations was \u201ccreated or modified in June 2020\u201d \u2014 the same month that Biden clinched the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 and alleges a \u201ccriminal scheme\u201d involving \u201cmoney for policy decisions.\u201d\n\nThe allegations are the first to have directly implicated Biden rather than his scandal-plagued son, Hunter, who is currently facing congressional and federal investigations into his overseas business dealings in countries including China, Ukraine and Russia.",
