    "text": "Fonda Heads To Canada For Oil Sands Protest, Manages To Tick Everyone Off \n\n Actress Jane Fonda\u2019s latest performance as a climate change activist drew a slew of criticism as she protested the Alberta oil sands in the Canadian province.\n\nFonda was castigated by locals, ambushed by a social media reporter and criticized by a left-leaning provincial premier. On Wednesday, at an Edmonton, Alberta news conference, she condemned a fellow-progressive, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying that \u201cpeople shouldn\u2019t be fooled by good-looking Liberals,\u201d and accused him of \u201cbetraying\u201d the Paris climate agreement.\n\nFonda claimed that, like President Barack Obama, her first impression of Trudeau was one of admiration: \u201cWhen I heard that your prime minister, the shining hope at the \u2026 Paris climate talks, who talked so beautifully about needing to meet the requirements of the climate treaty, and respect and hold to the treaties with the Indigenous people, and so forth \u2014 such a heroic stance he took there,\u201d Fonda said. \u201cAnd yet he has betrayed every one of the things that he committed to in Paris.\n\n\u201cI guess the lesson is we shouldn\u2019t be fooled by good-looking liberals, no matter how well spoken they are. What a disappointment.\u201d\n\nBut there was disappointment in the remarks of Alberta\u2019s premier, Rachel Notley, who leads the left-leaning provincial New Democratic Party. She called Fonda \u201ctone deaf\u201d and \u201cill-informed.\u201d\n\nFonda received an invitation from the Alberta government to discuss the oil sands but she refused.\n\n\u201cI would suggest if someone was going to come to Alberta \u2026 [and] fly over a city that is going through a significant economic downturn, that\u2019s just been through the largest natural disaster in the history of Canada, and then lecture them about where they should get jobs elsewhere, first of all, that\u2019s super tone deaf,\u201d Notley said.\n\nOn the first day of her oil sands protest, as she strolled through nearby Fort McMurray, Fonda was ambushed by social media reporter Robbie Picard.\n\nPicard, who hosts the Facebook group OilSands Strong, peppered Fonda with questions about the oil sands, asking her if she was aware of how many First Nations businesses have invested money in the project.\n\nThe episode was captured on video by a CBC journalist who was attempting to interview the actress. Fonda did not address any of the questions but insisted, \u201cI\u2019m on your side.\u201d",
