Tommy Tuberville: \u201cClimate Change is the Biggest Hoax in the World!\u2026 I Would Say \u201c25% of Budget\u201d Goes to It (VIDEO) \n\n Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville joined Steve Bannon on The War Room on Friday following Joe Biden\u2019s incredibly partisan and completely dishonest State of the Union Address to the American people last night in Washington DC.\n\nDuring their discussion, Tommy was asked about the climate change craze. The former Auburn coach did not hold back. Tuberville told the War Room audience, \u201cClimate Change is the biggest hoax in the world.\u201d He then added that he believes around 25% of the budget is dumped into climate change policies.\n\nThere are obviously a whole lot of grifters getting rich of the \u201choax.\u201d\n\nThe Democrat Party and their mainstream media will not be pleased with Tommy following his honest assessment of the international scam.\n\nSteve Bannon: Okay, so you\u2019re a common sense guy, right? Big education guy. You\u2019ve been around universities all your life. When you come and hear the presentations, when they come and present to you, is it nonsense? I mean, is it just voodoo?\n\nSen. Tuberville: Oh, the climate, yeah. Oh, it\u2019s biggest hoax in the world. I mean, it\u2019s all a money grab\u2026 We come in here at our budgets about near 5 trillion a year. What we run on, we\u2019ve spent since I\u2019ve been here, and I hadn\u2019t voted for any of $7 trillion more than that since we\u2019ve been here. Right. I would say 25% of that, Steve, has gone to climate change. I mean, it is the biggest hoax in the world. I mean, you\u2019ve got this clown Kerry. That John Kerry. He doesn\u2019t know what day it is most of the time. I think he\u2019s right behind Joe Biden, and he\u2019s pushed this narrative along with these money grabbers like Clinton and Gore and all the Democrats. I mean, it is all a money grab. This EV car system, you\u2019re seeing it now. It\u2019s crashing, crashing, burning. They can\u2019t get anything out of the solar, no wind\u2026\n\n\u2026I lived in West Texas, coach at university at Texas Tech. I had a wind turbine, huge one, in my backyard, a couple hundred yards. You could hear it going around\u2026\n\n\u2026But if the wind\u2019s not blowing on that turbine behind me, it\u2019s got an electric generator running it. Yeah, that\u2019s fueled by gas and oil. You just have to take a deep breath sometimes and see how deep of hole these people have dug themselves.\n\nSteve Bannon: Have they presented you any information or data or analysis that would make you say, some of this climate change stuff might be logical, or is it just all presented as essentially financial, economic voodoo?\n\nSen. Tuberville: Yeah, they don\u2019t know enough about it. Now, you can get some of these big scientists who come in and try to push, but you look at the graphs and the narratives that they bring in\u2026 It\u2019s a hoax. I\u2019m telling you, it is a huge hoax. We\u2019re all for our air, our water, taking care of what we do, but they\u2019re making money off this. And again, that\u2019s the Democrat party. They want to make money off everything they do.\n",
