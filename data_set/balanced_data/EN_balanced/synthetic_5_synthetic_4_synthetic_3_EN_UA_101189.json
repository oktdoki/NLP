So now we do not belong to any battalions or divisions.\"\n\nMost read in Football\n\nOrlov, whose call sign is \"Spaniard\", said they had been given approval to create a separate battalion, Espanola.\n\nThe hooligans’ battalion is 550 strong, including 100 operators of kamikaze drones used to attack Ukraine, he said.\n\nThe fighters say they are being equipped by football supporters from across Russia.\n\nOrlov said: “There are a huge number of them.\n\n“All over Russia, in fact - in different cities there are different football teams.\n\n“We tell them what we need [and they provide it].\"\n\nFive years ago, Putin’s regime desperately tried to crackdown on Russian hooligans and ultras - using an FSB crackdown to stop them ruining the FIFA World Cup, which Putin hosted.\n\nIn 2016, Russian hooligans were in pitch battles with English fans at the UEFA Euro tournament in France.\n\nNow they are formalised as an armed force, and seen as heroes.\n\nEspanola is currently recruiting “stormtroopers”, scout-saboteurs, snipers, drone operators, electronic warfare and air defence operators, portable ground reconnaissance station operators, anti-tank guided missile operators, anti aircraft specialists, communications specialists, mechanic-drivers, and medics.\n\nWould-be fighters are told they will “take a quick but deep course of study in all directions with a real opportunity - or rather the need - to become a ‘universal soldier’.”\n\nThey will “become a real military man and benefit the Motherland without delay”.\n\nAnd the stadium fighters will “get access and learn how to work with the most modern weapons, equipment and technologies\".\n\nSniper detachments “are provided with all the most advanced technologies — this applies to transport, equipment, and of course [guns].”\n\nRecruits are told they “may not be hooligans, but they should be close to us in spirit and comply with the main principles of Española in life”.\n\nRecruitment sessions have been held in Moscow and St Petersburg, as well as other cities.\n\nThey boast recruits from the hooligan armies of clubs like CSKA, Zenit, Spartak, Torpedo and Lokomotiv and the notorious Orel Butchers.\n\nSeveral are known to have died so far in the war, including CSKA Moscow fan Maxim Shmanin, 44.\n\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\n\nIt comes as Moscow attempts to enlist women prisoners and kids in a desperate war effort.\n\nPutin has already deployed convicted murderers and rapists in his desire to wipe the state of Ukraine off the map.",
