Russia will soon be free.\n\n\"The time to fight for the freedom of Russia has come.\n\n\"We want our children to grow up in peace and be free people... but that has no place in today's Putin's Russia.\"\n\nMost read in The Sun\n\nArmoured vehicles with Ukrainian markings were also spotted near the border, further fuelling rumours of an invasion by pro-Ukraine Russian saboteurs.\n\nSmoke was spotted in multiple locations near border checkpoints in the region, along with videos online appearing to show a Russian soldier dead inside a checkpoint building.\n\nAnd a helicopter was reportedly seen flying low over houses and deploying anti-missile flares in Rakitnoye, some 30 miles from the Grayvoron border crossing where the tank was spotted.\n\nOne post showed a radio message urgently telling Belgorod citizens to evacuate the area.\n\nGovernor Gladkov told residents earlier today: \"No one is hurt, the evacuation from Shebensky district is a lie.\n\n\"I urge you not to listen to enemies and not to panic.\"\n\nIn a post on Telegram, the Freedom of Russia Legion shared a photo of a \"free Russia\" flag on a bridge.\n\nThey said: \"The first flags of free Russia met the dawn over the liberated cities. Raise the flags in your cities too. Freedom is near!\"\n\nThe group claimed they had taken control of Kozinka and Gora-Podol villages.\n\nRumours spread that up to six other villages came under drone and mortar fire.\n\nThe flag raised in the photo is the flag used by Russian anti-war protesters - many of whom live in eastern Ukraine - and is also displayed on the Freedom of Russia Legion's Telegram channel.\n\nIt describes them as \"free citizens of Russia\" who are fighting against the \"dictatorial regime\" in Russia.\n\nAnother video widely shared online appeared to show the soldiers running into the streets of the southern Belgorod region.\n\nThis was followed by aerial shots of border towns showing smoke billowing from multiple buildings.\n\nRussian authorities said administrative building in the town of Golovchino was allegedly struck by a drone, and part of a rocket fell into the garden of a home in the village of Antonovka.\n\nAuthorities claimed to have full control of the villages and said they were hunting the \"terrorists\" involved in the incursion.\n\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\n\nIn March, Putin accused Ukraine of launching a terror attack after members of the Legion crossed the border further north.\n\nHowever footage showing it was a stunt by anti-Kremlin Russians waving flags for the camera.",
