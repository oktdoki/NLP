    "text": "UN Chief Warns of Global Economic Crisis at World Economic Forum in Davos \n\n United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres offered a grim outlook on the global economic during the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2023 summit in Davos, Switzerland, warning of a possible worldwide economic downturn.\n\nCiting the \u201cperfect storm\u201d of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war, high food prices, and high energy costs, Guterres said that there will be \u201chuge economic consequences\u201d around the world. He did not predict, however, when the slowdown would start.\n\nGuterres noted that economies outside the United States, Europe, and Asia would face worsening economic conditions. Developing countries in Africa, South America, and much of Asia are seeing rising interest rates, he noted.\n\n\u201cInterest rates are going up extremely in the global south. Countries are close to default. They have no resources because they couldn\u2019t print money like the United States did, like Europe did during the COVID-19 [pandemic],\u201d the UN chief told Bartiromo. \u201cThey have no access to concessional funding because many of them are middle-income countries. Look at small island developing states, the Caribbean islands.\u201d\n\nSome of those countries, he added, \u201clived on tourism\u201d and \u201ctourism has ended for two years, but as they are middle-income countries, they had no debt to live, they had no concessional funding.\u201d\n\nGuterres said that the United Nations is proposing a global stimulus plan to address economic woes, and claimed that economies should transition from oil and gas to other energy sources. \u201cWe need to do that in a just way,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthis transition needs to be well-managed.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the West and China need to have \u201cserious\u201d negotiations amid the dim global economic outlook, said the UN chief.\n\nOther WarningsWhile inflation has eased at the consumer and producer level in the United States in recent months, a number of economists and business leaders say that Americans should prepare for a recession starting in 2023. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to their highest levels in decades in order to cool high inflation that reached more than 9 percent in June 2022, though it has since dropped to below 7 percent.\n\n\u201cSome economists argue that the strength of the labor market\u2014as well as household balance sheets\u2014will keep the economy strong enough to avoid a recession,\u201d wrote Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji, co-founders of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, for CNN\u2019s website. \u201cWe disagree,\u201d they wrote, saying that \u201cit remains our expectation that the U.S. economy will enter a recession this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that Microsoft will emerge from this stronger and more competitive,\u201d Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees in a memo on company\u2019s website on Wednesday.\n\nOther tech firms, such as Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Salesforce, and Twitter, have announced similar moves in recent weeks. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, had 221,000 full-time employees as of June 30, 2022, according to government filings.",
