It originates from a site that is a regular source of misinformation and has been debunked by Check Your Fact several times in the past.\n\nFact Check:\n\nSome studies have suggested that climate change may be causing more turbulence on airplanes, according to Washington Post. In spite of this, airlines are getting better at anticipating rough skies, meaning there may not be much change in the overall rate of turbulence, the outlet reported.\n\nA Facebook post suggests Kerry has said people must die for the \u201cNew World Order.\u201d The post shows an image of Kerry smiling above the text, \u201cJohn Kerry\u2019s Daughter Says BILLIONS of Humans Must Die for the \u2018New World Order.'\u201d\n\n\u201cSo now we know\u2026 they are KILLING us with chemicals, shots, food is poisoned.. ENOUGH!!!\u201d the caption reads. (RELATED: No, John Kerry Has Not Called For Depopulation As A Part Of The United Nations\u2019 Agenda 2030)\n\nThe claim is baseless, however. There are no credible news reports to suggest Kerry said this. Likewise, the alleged statement could not be found on any of Kerry\u2019s social media accounts.\n\nThe image\u2019s text matches a headline from The People\u2019s Voice. A \u201cLiability Disclaimer\u201d included on the site\u2019s \u201cTerms of Use\u201d page indicates it \u201cmakes no representations about the suitability, reliability, availability, timeliness, and accuracy of the information, software, products, services and related graphics contained on the site for any purpose.\u201d Check Your Fact has debunked claims originating from this site multiple times previously.\n\nCheck Your Fact reached out to a Kerry spokesperson for comment and will update this piece accordingly if one is received.",
