    "text": "Israeli Official Warns Russia: You\u2019re Next \n\nAmir Weitmann, the head of the libertarian caucus in Israel\u2019s Likud Party, appeared on Russia\u2019s RT last week and expressed his outrage at Russia\u2019s stance on the war since fighting broke out.\n\n\u201cRussia is supporting the enemies of Israel. Russia is supporting Nazi people who want to commit genocide on us and Russia will pay the price,\u201d Weitmann said, according to Newsweek. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win this war. Afterwards, we\u2019re not forgetting what you\u2019re doing, we\u2019re not forgetting, we will come, we will make sure Ukraine wins. We will make sure that you pay the price for what you have done, you as Russia.\u201d\n\nThe host of the program said Moscow has been calling for a ceasefire and has been looking for a solution to the conflict in Israel.\n\n\u201cI understand you\u2019re on the Russian payroll, and I understand this is Russian propaganda. But you have to be very careful, because, let me tell you, we\u2019re going to finish this war. We\u2019re going to win because we\u2019re stronger,\u201d he said, according to The New Voice of Ukraine.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Putin once had a relatively close relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but since the outbreak of the Ukraine War, there seems to be a chill. The paper noted that as of Friday, the Russian leader has not reached out to his Israeli counterpart.\n\nInstead, Putin\u2014while condemning the Hamas attack\u2014said the incident was a \u201cclear example of the failure of United States policy in the Middle East.\u201d While making clear that he believes Israel has an obligation to defend itself, Washington\u2019s knee-jerk reaction is to never take into account the \u201cfundamental interests of the Palestinian people.\u201d\n\nErdogan seemed to agree, saying: \u201cIf the West has the slightest respect for human rights, it must discuss the types of aid that should be sent to Gaza. There is no way to bring peace to the Middle East except through establishing a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.\u201d\n",
