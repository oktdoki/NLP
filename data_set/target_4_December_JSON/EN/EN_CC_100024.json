    "text": "'Fraud On American Investors': Republicans Plan Crackdown On Woke Investing Following The Midterms \n\n Republican lawmakers will probe the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and large private investors for their role in pushing an environmental agenda throughout the financial sector after the midterm elections.\n\nRepublican Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said that investigating the Biden administration and Wall Street\u2019s use of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) principles will be a major focus of his committee if Republicans gain a majority in the House on Nov. 8, according to The Washington Post. The lawmakers argue that large financial institutions have withheld investment from businesses that they don\u2019t consider to be eco-friendly based on their ESG criteria.

The rule could allow climate-focused investors to more easily discern the \u201cclimate risks\u201d of certain businesses and pressure them to become more eco-friendly.\n\nRepublican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska introduced a bill in May to combat major investors\u2019 influence and will continue discussing such actions with industry executives, his spokesman told the Post.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve become the loud noise in their right ear after all the screaming in their left ear,\u201d Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said about GOP efforts to push back against Wall Street firms\u2019 climate-focused investment strategies, according to the Post.\n\nRepublican Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer of Missouri and ranking member on the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions told the Post that he wants to force BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street executives to testify in front of the financial services committee as the three massive money managers have used their financial influence to push companies to adopt their climate agenda and other political movements.\n\nBlackRock, which manages nearly $8 trillion in assets, has been scrutinized by Republican attorneys general and state treasurers over its alleged failure to place the interests of its investors above the firm\u2019s stance on climate change.\n\nThe Republicans are expected to take back the House in the midterm elections and will hold a majority in the House Financial Services Committee as well as other committees that can be used to probe the SEC, banks and asset managers.\n",
