We\u2019d urge everyone \u2013 consumers and businesses \u2013 if you don\u2019t use a brown bin, please start, and make a positive change for our environment,\u201d she added.\n\nIn Ireland it\u2019s estimated we waste about 750,000 tonnes of food each year. Food waste that ends up in landfill is a significant contributor to climate change \u2013 food waste is estimated to generate up to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing food waste has both environmental and financial benefits.\n\nThe brown bin service accepts all types of food: Raw and cooked meat and fish, plate scrapings, and fruit and vegetable peelings, in addition to food-soiled paper napkins, paper towels, greasy pizza boxes, and light garden waste.\n\nMyWaste.ie\u2019s top three ways to prevent food waste includes planning meals and using only the ingredients needed, storing food properly, and using your brown bin!
