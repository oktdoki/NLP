Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen said she lives in Kenya with solar power and clean electricity from the local utility.\n\n\u201cI'm not living in a cave,\" she added.\n\n\"That's all I can say.\u201d\n\nThe remarks from Al Jaber draw criticism from scientists and are in contrast with the view of Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who said at the climate summit on Friday,\n\n\u201cThe science is clear: The 1.5C limit is only possible if we ultimately stop burning all fossil fuels. Not reduce, not abate. Phase out, with a clear timeframe.\u201d\n\nAl Jaber\u2019s presidency of COP28 has stirred controversy in recent months. He is the first CEO designated to be president of any climate summit so far. But he is also the chief executive of the national oil company of OPEC's third-largest producer, the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\n\u201cThe recent comments from COP28 President show how entrenched he is in fossil fuel fantasy and is clearly determined that this COP doesn\u2019t do anything to harm the interests of the oil and gas industry,\" said Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa.\n\n\u201cThese remarks are a wake-up call to the world and negotiators at COP28 that they are not going to get any help from the COP presidency in delivering a strong outcome on a fossil fuel phase-out and will need to work hard to ensure a few petro-state leaders don\u2019t imperil the planet in their efforts to protect their oil profits.\"\n\nLast week, Al Jaber denied reports of plans to use the climate summit in Dubai to push oil deals.\n\nEarlier last week, the BBC and many other news outlets reported that the UAE planned to use its role as the host of climate talks to forge new oil and gas deals. The BBC cited leaked briefing documents obtained by independent journalists at the Centre for Climate Reporting working alongside the BBC. Those documents were purportedly prepared by the UAE\u2019s COP28 team for meetings with at least 27 foreign governments during the climate summit which Dubai will host from November 30 to December 12.",
