The new law carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence.\n\nOvsyannikova, whose father is Ukrainian and her mother Russian, spent the night in police custody.\n\n\u201cThese were very difficult days of my life because I literally went two full days without sleep, the interrogation lasted for more than 14 hours and they didn\u2019t allow me to contact my family and close friends, didn\u2019t provide any legal support,\u201d Ovsyannikova said.\n\nThe court ordered her to pay a fine of 30,000 rubles (about $270) on charges of organizing unsanctioned actions for her call to take part in demonstrations against the war.",
