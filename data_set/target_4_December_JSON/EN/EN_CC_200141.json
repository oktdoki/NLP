    "text": "The Great Reset King pollutes Christmas message with \u201cclimate change\u201d activism \n\n On Christmas day, when Christians are celebrating the birth of their Saviour, King Charles III used his Christmas message to push the \u201cclimate change\u201d narrative.\n\n\u201cOut of God\u2019s Providence, we are blessed with much and it is incumbent on us to use this wisely. However, service to others is but one way of honouring the whole of creation, which after all is a manifestation of the divine. This is a belief shared by all religions,\u201d Charles III said.\n\nThen he slipped seamlessly into climate activism. \u201cTo care for this creation is a responsibility owned by people of all faiths and of none. We care for the Earth for the sake of our children\u2019s children. During my lifetime I\u2019ve been so pleased to see a growing awareness of how we must protect the Earth and our natural world as the one home we all share.\u201d\n\nWhat has that message got to do with the birth of Jesus and Jesus\u2019 message for the world? Is he conflating religions? Is he attempting to dilute or usurp the \u201cOur Saviour is born\u201d message? Or, perhaps, he is attempting to merge his own beliefs into another to create a universal belief system he thinks we should all follow.\n\nBelow, Jordan Schachtel has more to say on Charles III using the world stage for his activism.\n\nOn Monday, King Charles III, who we sometimes refer to as the \u201cWEF King\u201d \u2013 because he\u2019s one of the world\u2019s most prominent anti-humans \u2013 dedicated a significant chunk of the Royal Family\u2019s annual Christmas broadcast to the climate narrative.\n\nCharles began with a unifying, apolitical message about having compassion for others, along with a plethora of unifying slogans, before quickly turning heel and going full Klaus Schwab mode, under the guise of presenting a cause that is greater than ourselves.\n\n\u201cWe care for the Earth for the sake of our children\u2019s children,\u201d said Charles, who earlier this month flew on his very spacious private aircraft to the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (\u201cCOP 28\u201d).\n\n\u201cDuring my lifetime I have been so pleased to see a growing awareness of how we must protect the Earth and our natural world as the one home which we all share,\u201d said Charles, who has been serving as king since September 2022.\n\nRead More: The Great Reset King pollutes Christmas message",
