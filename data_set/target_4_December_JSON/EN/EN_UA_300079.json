(@TulsiGabbard) April 14, 2022\n\nThis is a war between democracy and autocracy.\n\nWhile I agree that Russia is an autocracy, Ukraine is also an autocracy. Zelensky has banned his opposition, shutdown independent media and arrested and tortured his political opponents.\n\nThe world\u2019s autocracies include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Austria, the Baltic states, Slovakia, Greece, Germany and the United Kingdom. Germany is one of the world\u2019s leading police states and still uses the same Gestapo and Stasi tactics to crush its dissidents. The United States under Joe Biden is trending toward autocracy due to draconian censorship of social media and the expansion of the surveillance state and is only thwarted from moving further in that direction by the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe difference between British autocracy and Russian autocracy is that you can be arrested and imprisoned in the UK for \u201cmisgendering\u201d someone on Twitter.\n\nNote: I\u2019m pretty sure this website is blocked in several European autocracies.",
