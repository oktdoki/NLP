Putin certainly has the hardware for every scenario.\n\nAt his disposal are an estimated 5,977 warheads, of which 1,600 are ready to be deployed. This terrifying arsenal can be launched from land, submarines and planes.\n\nThey include non-strategic \u201cbattlefield\u201d nukes which have a smaller destructive power \u2014 and radioactive fallout \u2014 and are intended to destroy military capabilities rather than civilian populations. They can be anything from land mines to torpedos.\n\nThey have never been used in combat \u2014 so far.\n\nMost read in The Sun\n\nRussia also has the more feared strategic nuclear weapons, which can be launched as warheads on powerful long-range missiles.\n\nThey include intercontinental ballistic missiles which would take just 20 minutes to get to Britain \u2014 and 30 to the US. These strategic weapons, with deliberately terrifying names such as Satan, are designed to wipe out entire cities.\n\nUnleashing such weapons would come with a huge amount of risk for Putin. He knows Nato forces have an equally deadly stockpile, with the US retaining 5,428 warheads alongside the UK\u2019s 225 and France\u2019s 290.\n\nBut he may not care about retaliation.\n\nThe Russian leader suggested in 2018 he would be willing to see his homeland destroyed in a nuclear conflict.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf someone decides to annihilate Russia, we have the legal right to respond. Yes, it will be a catastrophe for humanity and for the world. But I\u2019m a citizen of Russia and its head of state.\n\n\u201cWhy do we need a world without Russia in it?\u201d\n\nThis, though, was clearly a threat to respond in kind if Russia is ever attacked first.\n\nSam Ashworth-Hayes, of the Henry Jackson Society, told The Sun previously: \u201cI think there is only a risk of escalation if Nato forces did directly become involved in the war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe message from Vladimir Putin to the West is to stay out of our business, because we will escalate if you interfere.\u201d\n\nNato has made it clear it has no intention of intervening militarily in Ukraine. But one Russian analyst speculated Putin might fire a nuclear warning shot our way.\n\nPavel Felgenhauer, of the independently minded Novaya Gazeta, said: \u201cOne option for him is to cut gas supplies to Europe, hoping that will make the Europeans climb down. Another option is to explode a nuclear weapon somewhere over the North Sea between Britain and Denmark \u2014 and see what happens.\u201d\n\nAnd US intelligence spies fear Russia might have an \u201cescalate to de-escalate\u201d policy, which means if they should find themselves in conflict with Nato, they would threaten to use low-yield nukes in order to bring a war to an end.\n\n'CONCERNING'\n\nMany wonder whether the former KGB spymaster has become unhinged enough to risk escalating a conflict in this way.\n\nBut one expert believes this could be a ploy. Professor Andrew Wilson, from UCL, said: \u201cPutin is playing a bit on the crazy. The theory goes that if people think I am mad enough to use them then that plays to my advantage.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mr Ashworth-Hayes thinks use of nukes is unlikely. He said: \u201cIt is important for people to stay calm. Tensions are very high, but there is no chance of either side launching nuclear weapons.\n\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\n\n\u201cBoth the US and Russia have more than enough warheads to wipe each other out.\n\n\u201cThe concept of \u2018mutually assured destruction\u2019 still stands.\u201d",
