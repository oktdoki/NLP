    "text": "Cows Join Bald Eagles, Whales On The Left\u2019s Climate Kill List \n\n What happened: European bureaucrats in dreary Ireland are plotting the murder of roughly 200,000 cows in order to combat so-called climate change.\n\n\u2022 Mass execution is one of the options being considered by the Irish government as it scrambles to satisfy the European Union\u2019s draconian emissions targets by 2030.\n\nContext: European libs aren\u2019t the only ones trying to erase cows from existence.\n\nIn 2019, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) promoted the controversial Green New Deal legislation using a fact sheet promising to \u201cfully get rid of farting cows and airplanes.\u201d\n\nWhy it matters: Liberal activists have long sought to alleviate their personality disorders, sometimes referred to as \u201cclimate anxiety,\u201d by killing innocent animals.\n\n\u2022 Former president Barack Obama deployed solar farms, wind farms, and other \u201cclean energy\u201d murder machines to execute thousands of bald eagles on his watch.\n\n\u2022 More recently, Democrats in New York and New Jersey have started slaughtering harmless whales in order to build a massive and unsightly offshore wind farm in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nCows are next on the kill list. Can humans be far behind?\n\nBottom line: Libs want these adorable creatures to die.\n\nRead more at Free Beacon\n\nJoin our list\n\nSubscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox.\n\nLivestock have been on his Earth for Thousands of year but its only now according to a bunch of total idiots their causing Global Warming/Climate Change. This is not about the Climate its about Big Green Brother in control of our Lives Gates and Soros are just two of the Enemy of Humanity\n\nBefore settlers from the new world reduced their numbers, American Bison in what is now the US, commonly referred to as buffalo, emitted almost as much methane as cattle do today. The climate change movement is always presenting phenomena as new and unprecedented be it heat waves, droughts, or methane from grazing animals.\n\nCattle farmers: Just say \u201cNO\u201d\n\nThe target policy will not affect atmospheric CO2 or the climate.\n\nThis kill-cattle instruction is bad, mad and completely cinelimate-ineffective.",
