    "text": "Bill Gates Admits \u2018Climate Crisis\u2019 Narrative Is a Hoax \n\n\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates has admitted that \u201cclimate crisis\u201d prophecies of doom are a hoax.\n\nIn a major U-turn, climate alarmist Gates backtracked and confessed that \u201cglobal warming\u201d does not have apocalyptic consequences.\n\nGates reportedly told a group of his fellow globalist green agenda advocates that the \u201cclimate doom\u201d narrative has now become so exaggerated that the public now sees right through the charade.\n\nThe admission from Gates is a major shift for the billionaire who has been a leading proponent of the \u201cclimate emergency\u201d narrative.\n\nFor years, Gates has been championing the \u201cNet Zero\u201d goals of the unelected bureaucratic and corporate elite.\n\nThe \u201cNet Zero\u201d targets, as dictated to global governments by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and United Nations (UN), seek to strip the public of their quality of life in order to eliminate so-called \u201ccarbon emissions\u201d by 2050.\n\nHowever, as Slay News has reported, analysts warn that meeting these unrealistic goals will cost the taxpaying public $75 trillion.\n\nEven after spending $75T, the world will still likely fall far short of the targets by 2050 and the globalists behind the policies will be long gone.\n\nIn 2021, Gates previously warned of apocalyptic consequences if the world fails to achieve \u201czero net carbon emissions\u201d by the year 2050.\n\nHe warned the then-host of \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d Chris Wallace in February 2021:\n\n\u201cThe migration that we saw out of Syria for their civil war, which was somewhat weather dependent, we\u2019re going to have 10 times as much migration because the equatorial areas will become unlivable.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to farm or go outside during the summer.\n\n\u201cWildfires, even the farming productivity in the south of the U.S. \u2013 the droughts \u2013 will reduce productivity in the area dramatically.\u201d\n\nGates went on to say that the loss of life would be greater than even the worst part of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe instability overall will be five times as many deaths at the peak of the pandemic and going up every year,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf we wait 10 more years it\u2019s not as bad as if we wait 20 or we wait 30, because the temperature just keeps going up,\u201d he said.",
