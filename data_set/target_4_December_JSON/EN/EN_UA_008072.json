    "text": "Putin Mobilizes More Troops, Hints at Nuclear Weapon Use in Conflict Over Ukraine \n\n Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 21 accused Western powers of engaging in nuclear blackmail and put his country onto an enhanced wartime footing, ordering a partial military mobilization and vowing to use \u201call means available\u201d in the event of a threat against Russia and its people.\n\n\u201cThose that allow such statements shall be reminded that our country also has various weapons of mass destruction,\u201d including some that are more advanced than those in NATO\u2019s arsenal, he added, according to a translation of his remarks by Sky News.\n\nAccusations Against the WestPutin accused the West of seeking to \u201cweaken, divide and ultimately destroy\u201d Russia, according to an official Kremlin translation of part of his speech, which was posted on the Kremlin website.\n\nClaiming that Western powers had concocted these plans long ago, Putin said they fomented anti-Russia terrorist activity in the Caucasus, moved \u201cNATO\u2019s offensive infrastructure\u201d near his country\u2019s borders, nurtured \u201chatred for Russia for decades,\u201d and intended to set up Ukraine as an \u201canti-Russia bridgehead.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told Russian state television that Putin\u2019s mobilization order would encompass reservists but wouldn\u2019t include students or anyone without prior military service.\n\nThe Russian leadership has been reluctant to order a broad military mobilization, portraying the invasion of Ukraine as a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d that\u2019s limited in scope.\n\nPutin\u2019s order marks the first time since World War Two that a military mobilization of Russian citizens has been invoked.\n\nCritical ReactionsPutin\u2019s move drew critical reactions from Western leaders and Ukrainian officials.\n\nBridget Brink, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, took to Twitter to describe Putin\u2019s order as a sign of \u201cweakness\u201d and \u201cfailure.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s Defense Secretary Ben Wallace was cited by The Scotsman as saying that Putin\u2019s order amounts to an admission of failure.\n\n\u201cPutin\u2019s breaking of his own promises not to mobilize parts of his population and the illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine, are an admission that his invasion is failing,\u201d Wallace said.\n\n\u201cNo amount of threats and propaganda can hide the fact that Ukraine is winning the war, the international community are united, and Russia is becoming a pariah,\u201d he added.\n\nAnxious investors fled risk assets following Putin\u2019s speech, while safe havens like bonds and the U.S. dollar rose.",
