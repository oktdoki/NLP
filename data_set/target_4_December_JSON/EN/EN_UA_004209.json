In response, Russia cut off electricity supplies to Finland on Friday.\n\nPutin told Niinisto that Finland\u2019s abandonment \u201cof its traditional policy of military neutrality would be an error since there are no threats to Finland\u2019s security,\u201d the Kremlin said in a statement issued after the call. \u201cSuch a change in the country\u2019s foreign policy could negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations, which had been built in the spirit of good neighborliness and partnership for many years, and were mutually beneficial.\u201d\n\nNiinisto\u2019s office said in a statement that he told Putin how starkly Finland\u2019s security environment had changed after Moscow\u2019s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe exchange came amid escalating rhetoric over the potential for NATO to expand beyond its current 30 members.\n\n\u201cIf Finland wants to join this bloc, then our goal is absolutely legitimate \u2014 to question the existence of this state. This is logical,\u201d said Aleksey Zhuravlyov, 59, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament\u2019s defense committee, said in an interview with The Mirror. \u201cThe Finns in general should be grateful to Russia for their statehood, for the fact that Finland exists as a country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the United States threatens our state, it\u2019s good: here is the Sarmat [Satan-2] for you, and there will be nuclear ashes from you if you think that Russia should not exist,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd Finland says that it is at one with the USA. Well, get in line.\u201d\n\nThe Satan-2 is a ballistic missile capable of carrying 10 to 15 nuclear warheads, with an estimated destructive power of three megatons each.\n\nRussia wouldn\u2019t need to move nukes to its European border to carry out its threat, officials boasted.\n\n\u201cWe can hit with a Sarmat [known in the West as Satan-2] from Siberia, and even reach the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we strike from Kaliningrad \u2026 the hypersonic\u2019s reaching time is 200 seconds \u2013 so go ahead, guys.\n\n\u201cOn the Finnish border we will have not strategic weapons, but Kinzhal-class, one that will reach Finland in 20 seconds, or even 10 seconds.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said Russia knows that NATO wants to \u201cmilitarize everything within reach,\u201d Interfax news agency reported.",
