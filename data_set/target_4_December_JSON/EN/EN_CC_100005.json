    "text": "Climate Crazies Fail in Attempt to Vandalize Another Classic Work of Art \n\n Another of the world\u2019s most recognized and most valuable pieces of art was the target of climate-change activists. Climate crazies tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to glue themselves to Edvard Munch\u2019s 1893 painting \u201cThe Scream\u201d in Oslo on Friday.\n\nIt was yet another example of climate change activists using priceless works of art to protest the use of fossil fuels, which climate zealots believe is leading to global warming. In October, climate activists attacked \u201cGirl with a Pearl Earring\u201d by Johannes Vermeer in The Hague. Climate hysterics were also responsible for an attack on Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cSunflowers\u201d and John Constable\u2019s \u201cThe Hay Wain\u201d in London over the summer.\n\nThe new climate-related vandalism fad seems to have begun with an attack on Da Vinci\u2019s \u201cMona Lisa\u201d in which a climate fanatic feigned a disability in order to get close enough to smear a pastry on the painting.\n\nIn addition, \u201cPeach Trees in Blossom\u201d by Van Gogh; \u201cMy Heart\u2019s in the Highlands\u201d by Horatio McCulloch; \u201cTomson\u2019s Aeolian Harp\u201d by J.M.W. Turner; \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d by Giampietrino; \u201cSistine Madonna\u201d by Raphael; and \u201cHaystacks\u201d by Monet have been targeted by climate hysterics since May.\n\nAs of yet, none of the artwork has been damaged, due to being protected by glass.\n\nVideo of Friday\u2019s attack shows two young climate vandals attempting to glue themselves to the artwork. Police apprehended the hooligans, and reported there was some glue residue on the glass that protects the paintings.\n\n\u201cI scream for people dying,\u201d one of the activists shouted.\n\n\u201cI scream when lawmakers ignore science,\u201d the other shouted.\n\nThe Norwegian climate activist group Stopp Oljeletinga, which translates to \u201cStop Oil Exploration,\u201d claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe group demands that the Norwegian government declare \u201can immediate halt to all further exploration for oil on the Norwegian continental shelf,\u201d and present \u201ca concrete plan for fair adjustment for today\u2019s oil workers.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the group claimed that the vandalism was an attempt to \u201cpressure lawmakers into stopping oil exploration.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are campaigning against \u2018Scream\u2019 because it is perhaps Norway\u2019s most famous painting,\u201d said Astrid Rem, a spokesperson for Stopp Oljeletinga. \u201cThere have been lots of similar actions around Europe. They have managed something that no other action has managed: achieve an extremely large amount of coverage and press.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s good press and there\u2019s bad press. These crazy antics are of the bad variety.\n\nNorway is one of the world\u2019s top oil exporters and provides oil and natural gas to much of Europe, a continent in the midst of a serious energy crunch brought about partly by the war in Ukraine. Russia, the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, has severely restricted supplies and has shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which it claims was sabotaged.\n\nWithout much-needed Norwegian fossil fuels, Europe could be in for an extremely cold winter.\n\nThe art world has acknowledged their concern over the new phenomenon:\n\n\u201cIn recent weeks, there have been several attacks on works of art in international museum collections. The activists responsible for them severely underestimate the fragility of these irreplaceable objects, which must be preserved as part of our world cultural heritage,\u201d read a statement signed by approximately one hundred gallery directors and museums.\n\nThese climate crazies are apparently willing to allow a continent to freeze this winter over their fears of an over-hyped \u201cproblem\u201d peddled by globalists who flew more than 400 carbon-spewing private jets to COP27 in Egypt last week. If they truly believe the hype surrounding climate change, they\u2019re targeting the wrong thing.",
