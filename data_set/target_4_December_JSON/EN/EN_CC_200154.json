He didn\u2019t inherit an economic catastrophe. He inherited an economy that was growing above six percent. He inherited an economic boom. So, everything since then has been a lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got inflation because they lied that we were in an economic catastrophe, so they overspent,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo, of course, right now you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Why can\u2019t I make sense of this?\u2019 It\u2019s because it\u2019s just lies.\u201d\n\nCarney then zeroed in on Biden\u2019s \u201cmiddle out and bottom up\u201d claim.\n\n\u201cNobody I\u2019ve talked to can explain what \u2018from the bottom up and the middle out\u2019 means at all,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s also not what they\u2019re doing. When they are having government-directed money flowing into the economy\u2014you know, all the subsidies for the Green New Deal stuff\u2014that\u2019s not from the bottom up. That\u2019s the top down.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a grift,\u201d Kudlow added. \u201cIt\u2019s money to donors, campaign donors. It\u2019s money to big corporations who buy into their DEI and climate change stuff. It\u2019s money to Democratic interest groups city by city, state by state. You are so right. It\u2019s totally top down.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not working either, because the American people are rejecting it all of the time. Whenever you see polls, they say they don\u2019t trust Biden,\u201d Carney noted.\n\nAn AP-NORC poll released this week found that 69 percent of Americans believe Biden\u2019s economy is \u201cpoor,\u201d and 64 percent disapprove of his management of the economy.\n\nCarney also commented on Friday\u2019s jobs report from the U.S. Labor Department, noting that despite the numbers coming in under expectations, the report \u201calmost guarantees two more hikes\u201d from the Federal Reserve.\n\nHe made this same point in Friday\u2019s Breitbart Business Digest, explaining that the June jobs report and data showing a 4.4 percent year-over-year growth in average hourly wages \u201care likely enough to lock-in a rate hike at the end-of-the-month Federal Open Market Committee meeting and tilt the balance in favor of another rate hike in September.\u201d\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",
