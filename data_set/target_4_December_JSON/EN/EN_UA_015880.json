The announcement comes just two days after he claimed that the troops have successfully captured the key Ukrainian city.\n\nThe claims were however refuted by Kyiv who said that it is hanging on to a corner of the eastern Ukrainian city and that battles are ongoing.\n\n\u201cWagner will leave Artemovsk from May 25 to June 1,\u201d Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin said in an audio recording on Telegram.\n\nBakhmut was previously known as Artemovsk to honour a Soviet revolutionary before Ukraine renamed it.\n\nBefore planning the transfer of control, Prigozhin readied troops on the western outskirts of the city.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf the ministry of defence does not have enough personnel, we have thousands of generals.\u201d\n\nPrigozhin has poured scathing criticism on Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and army chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov, accusing them of being incompetent and causing Moscow\u2019s large-scale losses in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nWagner fighters have spearheaded Russia\u2019s storming of Bakhmut and Prigozhin\u2019s influence has risen hugely during Moscow\u2019s Ukraine offensive.\n\nThe Russian military claimed on Saturday that it has successfully captured the much-contested eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.\n\nThe Wagner Group led the all-out offensive in the city. Earlier in the day, Prigozhin said that his troops had finally pushed the Ukrainians out of the last built-up area inside the city.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said in a statement, \u201cAs a result of offensive actions by Wagner assault units, supported by artillery and aviation of the Southern Group of Forces, the liberation of Artyomovsk has been completed.\u201d\n\n\u201cVladimir Putin congratulated the assault units of Wagner as well as all servicemen of units of the Russian armed forces who provided them with the necessary support and flank cover, on the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk (the Soviet-era name for Bakhmut),\u201d TASS agency quoted the Kremlin saying.\n\nWith inputs from agencies\n\nRead all the Latest News , Trending News , Cricket News , Bollywood News , India News and Entertainment News here.
