    "text": "NYC to begin tracking food purchases to make sure residents don\u2019t consume \u201ctoo much\u201d meat \n\n\nJust as he promised to do, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a left-wing Democrat, is going after people\u2019s meat with new plans to save the world from \u201cclimate change\u201d by forcing everyone to become a \u201cplant-based\u201d vegetarian or vegan.\n\nAlong with representatives from the Mayor\u2019s Office of Food Policy and the Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, Adams has announced the launch of a new \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d and household food consumption tracking scheme that aims to reduce the Big Apple\u2019s \u201ccarbon emissions\u201d by 33 percent by the year 2030.\n\n\nIn order to cut all that carbon, Adams and his allies are imposing new \u201ccaps on meat\u201d that, as the name suggests, will limit the amount of meat that New Yorkers are allowed to purchase and consume at public institutions \u2013 and eventually within their own homes as well.\n\n(Related: Last month, we warned you that Adams was planning to unleash a horrific new food policing apparatus against New Yorkers, and now he has.)\n\nEric Adams wants all New Yorkers to become vegans\n\nAt a pre-Earth Day event held at a Brooklyn culinary center run by NYC Health + Hospitals, the city\u2019s public health care system, Adams unveiled a chart depicting New York City\u2019s greenhouse gas inventory. This inventory supposedly tracks the carbon footprint generated by household food consumption.\n\nWith the help of American Express, C40 Cities, and EcoData, Adams revealed carbon emissions data about household food consumption, which was added to existing carbon emissions data on energy use, transportation, and waste.\n\nCommissioner Rohit Aggarwala from the NYC Department of Environmental Protection unveiled the new household food consumption data. Aggarwala, by the way, also founded the Google smart city subsidiary Sidewalk Labs, which collects data in order to forge \u201ca new standard for what cities have to do\u201d as a novel way to shape policy.\n\nWhile the inventory that Aggarwala presented will also now include greenhouse gas \u201cpollution\u201d from the production and consumption of consumer goods like clothing, air travel, and health care, Adams focused his efforts at the event specifically on the foods that New Yorkers consume \u2013 mainly meat and dairy, which he personally opposes.\n\n\u201cFood is the third-biggest source of cities\u2019 emissions right after buildings and transportation, but all food is not created equal,\u201d Adams unsubstantially stated. \u201cThe vast majority of food that is contributing to our emission crisis lies in meat and dairy products.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is easy to talk about the emissions that\u2019s coming from buildings and how it impacts our environment, but we now have to talk about beef. And I don\u2019t know if people are ready for this conversation.\u201d\n\nOther than fish, Adams reportedly abides by a \u201cplant-based\u201d vegan diet, which he says helped him overcome diabetes. He wrote a vegan cookbook to promote his personal dietary choices, which he now wants all New Yorkers to follow in order to stop \u201cglobal warming.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe already know that a plant-powered diet is better for your physical and mental health, and I am living proof of that,\u201d Adams declared. \u201cBut the reality is that thanks to this new inventory, we\u2019re finding out it is better for the planet.\u201d\n\nThe simplistic way in which Adams couched his argument against meat and dairy has already been debunked by people who are actually educated in such things, including Melissa McKendree, PhD, an agricultural economist at Michigan State University.\n\n\u201cDifferent meats have different kinds of greenhouse gas footprints,\u201d McKendree clarified about how pasture-raised animals do not harm the environment like feedlot animals do. \u201cAll land is not created equal.\u201d",
