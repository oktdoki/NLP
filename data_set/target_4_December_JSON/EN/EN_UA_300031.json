That was sadly predictable\n\nTo the editor: We\u2019re supposed to think there\u2019s such a thing as a \u201ccivil\u201d incursion into another country, especially when it\u2019s Russia attacking another former Soviet Union neighbor? (\u201cRussia\u2019s \u2018most hidden crime\u2019 in Ukraine war: Rape of women, girls, men and boys,\u201d Aug. 21)\n\nRape is synonymous with war and always has been.\n\nConsider the reality: Hordes of men run rampant across the landscape, destroying everything in their path. Russian President Vladimir Putin knew this would be one of the results, especially as men put in these positions consider women as meaningless objects, to be used, abused and discarded as nothing more than trash.\n\nWhen the dust finally settles, and these violent sexual criminals are facing justice in the world court, I truly hope the sentence fits the crime.\n\nReading some of the stories of women who\u2019ve managed to survive the assaults to mind and body makes me realize there is no civility and never will be until these crimes are erased from the books \u2014 and we all know that\u2019ll never happen, because this is another example of full-circle history.\n\nKathryn Louyse, Glendale\n\n..\n\nTo the editor: It was very difficult reading your article about Russian forces raping Ukrainian civilians. There are many crimes in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but not many as brutal and personal as rape.\n\nThe war will end someday, but the agony of being overtaken and sexually assaulted will never end for the victims who survived or their loved ones. They will carry the scars, both mental and physical, for the rest of their lives.\n\nMindy Taylor-Ross, Venice\n\n..\n\nTo the editor: It appears the Russian army will never change.\n\nRead \u201cA Woman in Berlin\u201d by anonymous. It is the true story of eight weeks in the conquered city of Berlin in 1945. Women in Berlin at that time did not ask each other, \u201cHave you been raped?\u201d They asked, \u201cHow many times?\u201d\n\nAfter her death, the anonymous author was revealed as Marta Hillers, a journalist and editor during and after World War II.\n\nRobert P.
