They use what is called the United States Historical Climatology Network (USHCN), which has physical stations all over the country.\n\nBut, the problem is, a large number of the stations they claim to be using don\u2019t even exist.\n\nSo, how does NOAA use temperature data that doesn\u2019t exist?\n\nWill this presidential election be the most important in American history?\n\nPer Zero Hedge:\n\nThe problem, say experts, is that an increasing number of USHCN\u2019s stations don\u2019t exist anymore.\n\n\u201cThey are physically gone\u2014but still report data\u2014like magic,\u201d said Lt. Col. John Shewchuk, a certified consulting meteorologist.\n\n\u201cNOAA fabricates temperature data for more than 30 percent of the 1,218 USHCN reporting stations that no longer exist.\u201d\n\nHe calls them \u201cghost\u201d stations.\n\nMr. Shewchuck said USHCN stations reached a maximum of 1,218 stations in 1957, but after 1990 the number of active stations began declining due to aging equipment and personnel retirements.\n\nNOAA still records data from these ghost stations by taking the temperature readings from surrounding stations, and recording their average for the ghost station, followed by an \u201cE,\u201d for estimate.\n\nSo much for \u201cscience.\u201d\n\nIf you can\u2019t prove it\u2026 just make it up.\n\nThis is from the \u201ctrust the science\u201d fools.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, or Truth Social @WarnerToddHuston\n\nCross-posted with The Lid\n\nRelated:\n\n- Next Loony Liberal Crusade: They Want to Take Your Coffee Away \u2014 For Global Warming, Of Course (Video)\n\n- COP28 Head Tells Crowd There\u2019s \u201cNo Science\u201d Backing Phase-Out Of Fossil Fuels To Stop Global Warming\n\n- Norway Study Concludes There Is NO Man-Made Global Warming\n\n- Bill Gates Bankrolling DESTRUCTION OF ALL TREES To Stop \u201cGlobal Warming\u201d (Video)\n\n- Will Biden Block Sunlight To Cut Global Warming?\n\nTurn your back on Big Tech oligarchs and join the New Resistance NOW!
