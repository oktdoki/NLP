Now I think his luck is over,\" Mr Bondarev told Sky News.\n\n\"You should have no doubt about it, he may sacrifice 10 or 20 million Russians just to win this war just to slaughter all Ukrainians because it's a matter of principle.\n\n\"It's a matter of political survival to him. You have to understand that, if he loses the war, it will be the end for him.\"\n\nBondarev added: \"After losing the war, he will have to explain to his elites and his population why it is so and he may find some problems in explaining this.\n\n\"And after that there may be opposition who will try to depose him or he will try to purge his subordinates to find some people who could be blamed for all these problems.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Russian war boss Sergei Shoigu warned that the brutal warzone is risking \"uncontrolled escalation\" as Putin's forces continue to be pushed back across the frontline.\n\nShoigu suggested that Ukraine could actually be the one to detonate a \"dirty bomb\" - an explosive laced with radioactive material.\n\nAnd while not a true nuclear weapon, the consequences of using such a device could be catastrophic.\n\nBut it has been Russia wildly swinging the nuclear sabre during the war - and the latest allegation could be another diversion tactic.\n\nPutin's forces like to spread as much chaos and misinformation as possible to cover their own tracks.\n\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\n\nRead More on The Sun\n\nAnd so Shoigu's warning sparks fears over what the Russians may be planning as they are beaten back across the frontline.\n\nAs expected, Russia presented no evidence for their claims.",
