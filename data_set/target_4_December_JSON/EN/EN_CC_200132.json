Farming uses nitrogen, and suddenly, nitrogen is the new antagonist in the tale of global warming. The narrative is simple: eliminate nitrogen, and save the world. Yet, in the name of \u201cpreservation,\u201d entire segments of our food production are under siege.\n\nConsider rice \u2013 a staple for half the world\u2019s population. Renowned agencies claim, \u201cRice accounts for roughly 10% of global methane emissions,\u201d emphasising the urgent need to curtail its production. But the ramifications? Starvation for billions.\n\nLook to the Netherlands for further evidence. Dutch farmers, the backbone of a nation that is a leading exporter of meat and agricultural products, are being chased off their lands. A staggering number, 3,000 farms, are forecasted to be confiscated in the coming years. The tragic fallout is evident, with a reported 20 to 30 farmers tragically ending their lives annually.\n\nOur friends in Europe are no strangers to these baffling decisions either. The European Commission greenlit a strategy to compensate livestock farmers for halting their operations in certain areas \u2013 with a stipulation that they never resume their animal breeding activities. The implications are clear: a drop in global food availability and an inevitable spike in prices.\n\nRemember Sri Lanka\u2019s ill-fated venture into 100% organic farming? The island nation faced a humanitarian nightmare with a staggering 90% of its population on the brink of starvation.\n\nRead more: Globalists\u2019 war on the world\u2019s food supply",
