    "text": "Biden's Climate Bureaucrats Set Their Sights On Americans' Insurance \n\n The Treasury Department announced Tuesday that it is moving to amass data from private insurance companies to assess the financial risks of climate change on homeowners across the country.\n\nThe department\u2019s Federal Insurance Office (FIO) is proposing a new regulation that will gather homeowners\u2019 and businesses\u2019 data from property and casualty insurers, according to a press release. The FIO will use the data to determine whether private insurance coverage will be disrupted in areas of the nation that are vulnerable to \u201cclimate change impacts.\u201d(RELATED: The Fed\u2019s Plan To Battle Inflation Could End Up Making Energy More Expensive. Here\u2019s How)\n\n\u201cFIO\u2019s data collection will add to the work of regulators and policymakers across the Administration to assess climate-related risks to the financial system, the U.S. economy, and the American people,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement provided by the press release.\n\nIf the regulation is implemented it would apply to all large property and casualty insurers; however, it would not apply to small insurers with policies worth less than $100 million, with the exception of those in 10 high-risk states as determined by The Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to a summary of the proposal. The information would be gathered by ZIP code and would not include information about individual homeowners\u2019 policies but would also request data from five years ago to determine market patterns.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed an executive order in May 2021 to direct the FIO to assess the risk that the \u201cclimate crisis\u201d poses to private insurance coverage. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a government office of financial regulators, deemed climate change to be an \u201cemerging and increasing threat,\u201d according to an October 2021 report.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action by the Federal Insurance Office is an important step in determining how Americans are being affected by the increasing costs of climate change,\u201d Yellen stated.\n\nThe Treasury Department did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.
