And by recreating that feeling of safety, children will start to learn again and to dream of their futures.\"\n\nIt comes after Piers Morgan praised Ukrainian President Zelensky and the First Lady for their resilience over the war with Russia.\n\nThe TalkTV host arrived in Kyiv earlier today to join Olena Zelenska for a summit meeting to help shine a light on the toll of Russia's invasion.\n\nZelensky's wife chaired the international event - The Second Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen - which marks the 150th day of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPiers was quick to praise the Presidential couple as \"inspiring\" before saying that it was a \"great privilege\" to be welcomed in Kyiv.\n\nHe said: \"I wanted to say to the First Lady just how inspiring the world finds you and your husband. The way that you have rallied the people of Ukraine, is amazing to watch.\n\n\u201cI had the honour of being invited here and I couldn\u2019t wait to come to Ukraine and see for myself the resilience of the people here. You are a remarkable people.\n\n\u201cI have never met any country that has this strength and resilience with the possible exception of my country in World War Two.\n\n\u201cAnd I think it\u2019s an amazing thing to watch, so I think you should be incredibly proud not just of your leaders but of the people.\"\n\nAlongside Piers, other famous faces participated remotely in the summit, including Richard Gere, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis.",
