    "text": "Why the Media Don\u2019t Want to Know the Truth About the Nord Stream Blasts \n\n by Jonathan Cook, The Unz Review:\n\nNo one but the terminally na\u00efve should be surprised that security services lie \u2013 and that they are all but certain to cover their tracks when they carry out operations that either violate domestic or international law or that would be near-universally rejected by their own populations.\n\nWhich is reason enough why anyone following the fallout from explosions last September that ripped holes in three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea supplying Russian gas to Europe should be wary of accepting anything Western agencies have to say on the matter.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nIn fact, the only thing that Western publics should trust is the consensus among \u201cinvestigators\u201d that the three simultaneous blasts deep underwater on the pipelines \u2013 a fourth charge apparently failed to detonate \u2013 were sabotage, not some freak coincidental accident.\n\nSomeone blew up the Nord Stream pipelines, creating an untold environmental catastrophe as the pipes leaked huge quantities of methane, a supremely active global-warming gas. It was an act of unrivaled industrial and environmental terrorism.\n\nIf Washington had been able to pin the explosions on Russia, as it initially hoped, it would have done so with full vigor. There is nothing Western states would like more than to intensify world fury against Moscow, especially in the context of NATO\u2019s express efforts to \u201cweaken\u201d Russia through a proxy war waged in Ukraine.\n\nBut, after the claim made the rounds of front pages for a week or two, the story of Russia destroying its own pipelines was quietly shelved. That was partly because it seemed too difficult to maintain a narrative in which Moscow chose to destroy a critical part of its own energy infrastructure.\n\nNot only did the explosions cause Russia great financial harm \u2013 the country\u2019s gas and oil revenues regularly financed nearly half of its annual budget \u2013 but the blasts removed Moscow\u2019s chief influence over Germany, which had been until then heavily dependent on Russian gas. The initial media story required the Western public to believe that President Vladimir Putin willingly shot himself in the foot, losing his only leverage over European resolve to impose economic sanctions on his country.\n\nBut even more than the complete lack of a Russian motive, Western states knew they would be unable to build a plausible forensic case against Moscow for the Nord Stream blasts.\n\nInstead, with no chance to milk the explosions for propaganda value, official Western interest in explaining what had happened to the Nord Stream pipelines wilted, despite the enormity of the event. That was reflected for months in an almost complete absence of media coverage.\n\nWhen the matter was raised, it was to argue that separate investigations by Sweden, Germany and Denmark were all drawing a blank. Sweden even refused to share any of its findings with Germany and Denmark, arguing that to do so would harm its \u201cnational security.\u201d\n\nNo one, again including the Western media, raised an eyebrow or showed a flicker of interest in what might be really going on behind the scenes. Western states and their compliant corporate media seemed quite ready to settle for the conclusion that this was a mystery cocooned in an enigma.\n\nIsolated and friendless\n\nIt might have stayed that way forever, except that in February, a journalist \u2013 one of the most acclaimed investigative reporters of the past half-century \u2013 produced an account that finally demystified the explosions. Drawing on at least one anonymous, highly placed informant, Seymour Hersh pointed the finger for the explosions directly at the US administration and President Joe Biden himself.",
