Some onlookers waved American flags.\n\nNorth Macedonia was the last nation to join NATO in 2020 and Montenegro did it in 2017, both despite strong opposition from Russia.\n\nNorth Macedonia\u2019s Army Chief of Stuff, Lt. Colonel Jovan Azmanovski, told TV broadcaster Kanal 5 that the bombers\u2019 flights were symbolic proof that \u201cour skies are safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople in North Macedonia were able to see a flights of USAF B52 two strategic bombers over Skopje, which demonstrate our NATO membership and the safety and security of our and skies of entire alliance. Our skies are safe and our (NATO) membership is more than visible,\u201d Azmanovski said.\n\nIn Tirana, Albanian Army Chief of Staff Arben Kingji said \u201cwe are witnessing a strategic military demonstration.\"\n\n\u201cOur strategic partners are hand to hand with us, it\u2019s a message of unity,\" he said at the square where people gathered.\n\nThe two B-52 Stratofortress aircraft are assigned to the 23rd Bomb Squadron currently operating out of RAF Fairford, United Kingdom.\n\nSince 2018, the U.S. has conducted more than 200 Bomber Task Force sorties with allies and partners.\n\nMost recently, this involved B-1B Lancer flights over the Nordic, Baltic, and Black Sea regions in May, as well as an air policing overflight of North Macedonia in June. In June, Stratofortresses conducted flights over the Arctic Ocean, and later took part in BALTOPS, the largest annual exercise in the Baltic Sea.\n\nIn the Baltic Sea, the amphibious warship USS Kearsarge -- the largest warship ever to visit Lithuania \u2014 was officially welcomed Monday. The country borders fellow NATO member Poland and Belarus, a Moscow ally.\n\nOn Monday, the NATO air police mission in Lithuania reported that jets were scrambled four times last week to identify and escort Russian war planes, which violated rules of international airspace.\nibuted.",
