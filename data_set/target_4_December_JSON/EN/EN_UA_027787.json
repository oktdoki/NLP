    "text": "Russia Says US Is Responsible for Deadly Ukrainian Attack on Crimea \n\n MOSCOW\u2014Russia said on Sunday that the United States was responsible for a Ukrainian attack on Crimean peninsula with five U.S.\u2013supplied missiles that killed four people, including two children, and injured 151 more.\n\nThe Russian Defence Ministry said four of the U.S.\u2013delivered Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, equipped with cluster warheads, were shot down by air defense systems and the ammunition of a fifth had detonated in mid-air.\n\nFootage on Russian state television showed people running from a beach and some people being carried off on sun loungers.\n\nRussian authorities in Crimea said missile fragments had fallen just after noon near a beach on the north side of the city of Sevastopol where locals were on holiday.\n\nThe incident generated a furious reaction among Russian public figures.\n\nThe Defense Ministry said U.S. specialists had set the missiles\u2019 flight coordinates on the basis of information from U.S. spy satellites, meaning Washington was directly responsible.\n\n\u201cResponsibility for the deliberate missile attack on the civilians of Sevastopol is borne above all by Washington, which supplied these weapons to Ukraine, and by the Kyiv regime, from whose territory this strike was carried out,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nRussia sent its troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nThe United States began supplying Ukraine with longer range ATACMS missiles, which have a 300-kilometre (186-mile) range, earlier this year.\n\nTreating the InjuredSevastopol Governor Mihail Razvozhaev put the death toll at four, with 144 injured, including 82 taken to hospitals. Twenty-seven children were among the injured.\n\nSpecialist doctors were being flown in from other parts of Russia.\n\nRussia will respond to Sunday\u2019s attack, the Defense Ministry said, without elaborating. The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had been \u201cin constant contact with the military\u201d since the attack.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council, described the incident as \u201ca vile, despicable act against our people.\u201d\n\nHe likened it to attacks carried out by gunmen on Sunday against a synagogue, a church, and police post in Dagestan and said there was \u201cno difference to us\u201d between the U.S. administration, Ukrainian leaders, and \u201ccrazy fanatics.\u201d\n\nRussian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill said there \u201cwas no justification whatsoever for a missile strike on civilians\u201d and expressed indignation that the incident occurred on the Orthodox holiday of Trinity.\n\nNeither Ukraine nor the United States has commented on the attack, which came on a day when Ukraine said one person had been killed and 10 others wounded by Russian strikes on the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.",
