Feel free to repost and share widely Global Research articles.\n\nIn a recently unearthed video of the College of Global Public Health Center for Bioethics at New York University Director, Dr. Matthew Liao, speaking at the 2016 World Science Festival, he openly advocates artificially inducing a red meat allergy in the entire human population, using an analog of the algha-gal molecule found in the Lone Star Tick that I have documented previously at Armageddon Prose, so as to fight \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPeople eat too much meat. And if they were to cut down on their consumption on meat, then it would actually really help the planet.\n\nBut people are not willing to give up meat. Some people will be willing to, but other people \u2013 they may be willing to but they have a weakness of will. They say \u2018this steak is just too juicy, I can\u2019t do that.\u2019 I\u2019m one of those by the way.\n\nSo here\u2019s a thought. So it turns out that we know a lot about \u2014 we have these intolerances\u2026 For example, I have a milk intolerance. And some people are intolerant to crayfish. So possibly we can use human engineering to make the case that we\u2019re intolerant to certain kinds of meat, to certain kinds of bovine proteins\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s this thing called the Lone Star tick where if it bites you, you will become allergic to meat\u2026 So that\u2019s something we can do through human engineering. We can possibly address really big world problems through human engineering.\u201d\n\nThis level of evil \u2013 openly plotting to trigger autoimmune disease in humans without their consent at the population level \u2013 is nearly unspeakable.\n\nAt the same forum, Liao advocated \u201cediting\u201d humans to become \u201cso small that we get eaten by cats,\u201d again for the sake of \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\nWere these psychopaths to succeed with this and any of their many other bioengineering projects under the guises of Public Health\u2122, fighting \u201cclimate change,\u201d etc., then nothing the Third Reich did, or even fantasized doing in Dr. Mengele\u2019s wildest dreams, to the undesirables would remotely compare.\n\nThis is a war \u2013 of a different kind than we have seen historically \u2013 \u201cunrestricted warfare,\u201d as the CCP calls it \u2014 but a war nonetheless. As such, we need Nuremberg II now. People like Matthew Liao are not civilians; they must be reclassified as enemy combatants and given military tribunal trials.\n\nI don\u2019t know how this is going to be politically feasible, given the highly controlled and totally compromised political machine in the US and across the West, \u201cpenetrated\u201d by the WEF, in the words of Klaus Schwab, as they are.\n",
