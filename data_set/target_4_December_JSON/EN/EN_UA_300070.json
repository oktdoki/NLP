Washington continues to throw billions of dollars into the fire of the Ukraine conflict despite its ballooning debt, Russia\u2019s ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov has said.\n\nThe U.S. empire is becoming the laughing stock of the world over its insistence on pushing war and death for profit. Antonov made the comments after Washington approved a new tranche of aid to Kiev on the day when its debt reached a new milestone of $35 trillion.\n\nMonday\u2019s announcement by the Pentagon said that the U.S. will send an additional $1.7 billion in military aid to Ukraine because of an \u201caccounting error\u201d that somehow allows for more military spending.
