  "text": "Review: ‘The Out-Laws’ is a criminal waste of time \n\n LONDON: A producer’s credit for Adam Sandler is not quite the badge of honor it used to be, and nowhere is that more evident than in new Netflix comedy “The Out-Laws.”\n\nThis ostensibly funny heist movie stars Adam DeVine as bank manager Owen Browning, a bumbling (yet, the film insists, lovable) dork who suspects that his soon-to-be in-laws might have robbed his bank and then attempted to frame him.\n\nSaid in-laws are Billy (Pierce Brosnan) and Lilly (Ellen Barkin), a pair of suave, sophisticated rogues who insist they are definitely not an infamous crime duo known as the Ghost Bandits — spoiler alert, they are — and simply want to prevent their daughter Parker (Nina Dobrev) from marrying a man they see as not good enough.\n\nOwen thinks he can charm anyone, so sets about winning their hearts by getting drunk, jumping out of a plane, and getting a tattoo in a bid to win them over.\n\nCue a convoluted plot meander which sees Owen teaming up with Billy and Lilly to knock over a rival bank to pay off the Bandits’ debts to a criminal kingpin, and which serves as a jumping-off point for a series of hackneyed jokes about genitalia and inappropriate bodily contact.\n\nBrosnan and Barkin, to their credit, do their best with that they are given, but playing opposite DeVine’s rubber-faced (albeit well-meaning) imbecile would ask a lot of any actors. Michael Rooker seems equally embarrassed as a grizzled FBI agent, but at least Richard Kind and Julie Hagerty bring some laughs as Owen’s strait-laced parents.\n\nSadly, for every halfway decent joke in the movie (there is a good James Bond quip, at least), there is a plethora of overblown, silly set pieces which trade on the kind of surreal “wackiness” at which Adam Sandler, at the peak of his powers, used to excel.\n\nUnfortunately, for “The Out-Laws,” we are a long way from those heady days, and this flaccid comedy makes you feel every one of its 95 minutes.",
