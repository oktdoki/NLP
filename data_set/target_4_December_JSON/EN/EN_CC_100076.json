    "text": "Reuters Joins BBC in Failed \u2018Fact Check\u2019 of Daily Sceptic Arctic Sea Ice Story \n\n Another day, another fatuous \u2018fact\u2019 check from Reuters. This time the news agency accuses the Daily Sceptic of \u201ccherry-picking\u201d Arctic sea ice extent data to provide a \u201cmisleading\u201d story. Being accused of \u201ccherry picking\u201d by an outfit that funds a course for journalists that encourages them to pick a fruit such as a mango and discuss why it isn\u2019t as tasty as the year before due to climate change is beyond ridicule. Taking lectures on responsible journalism from a Net Zero-obsessed operation that has promoted a course speaker who has suggested \u201cfines and imprisonments\u201d for expressing scepticism about \u201cwell supported\u201d science is laughable, if also a tad sinister.\n\nOne of the activists called to admonish the Daily Sceptic with a \u2018straw man\u2019 argument was Walt Meier, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, who said: \u201cComparing two specific years is not an indicator for or against long-term changes\u201d. The Daily Sceptic did not do that. Interestingly, this would appear to be the same Walt Meier whose comments on \u201dmind blowing\u201d low winter levels of Antarctica sea ice last year made headlines around the world. Meier claimed at the time that it was \u201coutside anything we have seen\u201d. Happily, the Daily Sceptic was able to remind Meier that he had been part of a team a decade ago that cracked open the secrets of early Nimbus weather satellites and found a similar sea ice low in 1966. At the time, Meier commented that the Nimbus data show there is variability in Antarctica sea ice \u201cthat\u2019s larger than any we have seen\u201d since 1979.\n\nRead more: Reuters Joins BBC in Failed \u2018Fact Check\u2019 of Daily Sceptic Arctic Sea Ice Story",
