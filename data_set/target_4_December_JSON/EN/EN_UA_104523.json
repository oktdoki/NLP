    "text": "The Lies that All Pro-U.S.-Government Media Spread \n\n by Eric Zuesse, The Duran:\n\nFirst here, are a group of lies that all are false, all for the very same reason \u2014 that they all blatantly contradict the actual (as is to be documented here) history (just click onto each given lying phrase below, to see instances in which the given false phrase has been reported as being instead true \u2014 and, then, I shall here document them all to be not just false but the reverse of truth, the exact opposite of the reality):\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine\u201d (commonly used in U.S.-and-allied official Government statements).\n\n\u201cunprovoked war in Ukraine\u201d (two typical examples using it are this and this).\n\n\u201cRussian aggression against Ukraine\u201d (two typical examples using it are this and this).\n\nAny alleged report that employs any such phrase is propaganda \u2014 lying \u2018news\u2019 or \u2018history\u2019 \u2014 that bases itself upon the false unstated assumption that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 started the war in Ukraine, instead of responded to a war in Ukraine that U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s Administration (including Joe Biden) \u2014 the American Government \u2014 had actually started there, in 2014, against Ukraine\u2019s adjoining nation of Russia. America is planning ultimately to invade Russia from the only nation that is only 300 miles away from Moscow (Russia\u2019s central command \u2014 far closer than Cuba was to Washington DC during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis).\n\nHere, as proven in the links, are the historical facts, documenting the U.S. Government\u2019s increasing aggression against Russia \u2014 using Ukraine as its primary springboard in its plan to conquer Russia:\n\nThe Obama Administration perpetrated in February 2014 a bloody Ukrainian coup (hidden behind popular anti-corruption Ukrainian demonstrations that the CIA and State Department had trained and organized local racist-fascist anti-Russian Ukrainians to lead) overthrowing the democratically elected President of Ukraine and replacing him by a racist-fascist (ideologically nazi) regime that immediately replaced Ukraine\u2019s generals with ones to ethnically cleanse pro-Russian Ukrainians and kill some and terrorize the others to flee into Russia so as to get rid of the people in the Ukrainian regions that had voted 70% or more for that democratically elected President \u2014 and this ethnic cleansing would enable the nazi U.S.-installed regime in Ukraine to be \u2018democratically elected\u2019, and so to continue the U.S.-Government\u2019s control over that country, on Russia\u2019s border.\n\nFor the full details, see this.\n\nSo: all three of those phrases (\u201cRussia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine\u201d, \u201cunprovoked war in Ukraine\u201d, and \u201cRussian aggression against Ukraine\u201d) are lies, which reverse the aggressor (purportedly Russia, but actually America) and the defender (purportedly Ukraine \u2014 which is America\u2019s proxy in its war against Russia \u2014 but actually Russia).\n\nThe war in Ukraine started with Obama\u2019s coup, not with Putin\u2019s ultimate response to it (which occurred soon after America\u2019s rejection on 7 January 2022, of Russia\u2019s demand, NOT to allow Ukraine into NATO).\n\nAmerica\u2019s plan here is to place its missiles on Ukraine\u2019s border with Russia, only a five-minute-missile-flight away from blitz-nuking The Kremlin and thereby beheading Russia\u2019s central command \u2014 too fast for Russia to be able to launch its retaliatory missiles.\n\nWhat is the power of lies?\n\nIn a U.N. General Assembly vote on November 14th, the U.N. General Assembly (which has no power) voted by 94 votes for, 73 abstentions, and only 14 votes against, a Resolution to demand that Russia pay restitution to Ukraine, for the war in Ukraine \u2014 that America started against Russia by its 2014 coup.",
