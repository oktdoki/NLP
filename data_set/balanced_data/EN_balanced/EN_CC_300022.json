The military has dispatched nine water-carrying helicopters and two airplanes to the scene.\n\nOn Sunday, 86 members of Spain's Military Emergency Unity also arrived on the island.\n\nThe fire is on the western side of the island on wooded, hilly terrain dotted with homes.\n\nLa Palma, with a population of 85,000, is one of eight members of Spain’s Canary Islands archipelago off Africa’s western coast. In 2021, it was hit by a volcanic eruption that lasted around three months, forcing thousands to evacuate and causing around €900 million ($1.01 billion) of damage.\n\nPatricia Sanchez of the Spanish Red Cross told AFP news agency she felt \"powerless\" in knowing that \"there are people who lost everything because of the volcano and have rebuilt their lives in the north, and now they are evacuated again... and risk losing everything again.\"\n\nThe wildfire on La Palma coincides with blistering heat that has swept southern European countries, as scientists warn climate change could significantly increase wildfires across the globe.\n",
