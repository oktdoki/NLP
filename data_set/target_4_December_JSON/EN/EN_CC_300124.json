I've donated money to Labour for many years, to help them compete and hopefully win the election. I believe they will make Britain a better country.\n\nA Labour source said: 'The onshore wind ban put up energy bills for families and made Britain more energy insecure.\n\n'By lifting the ban, this Labour Government is cutting bills for families and boosting Britain's energy independence.'",
