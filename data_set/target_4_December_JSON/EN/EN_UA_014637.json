I chose a quick death.\"\n\nTimur, who had no military experience said he had two weeks of training before being deployed to Bakhmut- where one of the bloodiest battles of the war happened.\n\nMost read in The Sun\n\nHe said that the unit's commanders \"repeated many times, \u2018if you try to leave this field, we will shoot you.\u2019\"\n\nWhile he was captured, he said that most of the soldiers were killed on their first day.\n\nAnother soldier named Ruslan, 42, said he welcomed Wagner's acceptance of HIV-positive inmates and joined the frontline for a chance at medication and freedom.\n\nHe said: \"If you have a long sentence, it gives you a chance to begin life again.\"\n\nNew conscripts in Putin's private army were forced to wear coloured-coded wristbands to signify they had serious infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C.\n\nEarlier this year, Ukraine's Ministry of Defence claimed that Russia marks these \"sick 'fighters' with appropriate bracelets on their hands\".\n\n\"In order to 'mark' infected militants, the command of 'Wagners' forces them to wear red bracelets on the arm in case of HIV, and white bracelets in case of hepatitis,\" the Ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence said in a statement.\n\nThe report suggested that Russian conscripts were furious about having to serve alongside \"infected\" militants and military doctors regularly refused to provide assistance to the infected soldiers if they got wounded on the battlefield.\n\nAnother HIV prisoner Yevgeny who suffered a gunshot wound before he was captured, said that although he did receive treatment, he felt medics were careless about infecting other patients around him.\n\nHe said: \"There were no conditions for the HIV infected.\n\n\"We were all treated together, the healthy and the unhealthy.\"\n\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\n\nIt is estimated a total of 50,000 prisoners have signed up to fight in Ukraine, roughly 10 per cent of the incarcerated population.\n\nWagner's chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as \"Putin's chef\", was pictured trying to recruit inmates from Russia's penal colonies, promising them their freedom in return for six months on the frontline.",
