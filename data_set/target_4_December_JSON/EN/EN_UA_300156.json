Vladimir Putin also polls poorly with Republican voters. The hawks clearly think that they are on the upswing in the GOP.\n\n\u201cBack in February, we had a pretty good idea what was going on. Video and satellite imagery had shown the steady increase and massing of Russian troops, tanks, and military supplies around Ukraine\u2019s borders. Vladimir Putin had started wars before \u2014 and here he was again, on the precipice of something truly horrific.\n\nWhat bothered me was the extent to which several high-profile populist conservatives were seeming to reflexively side with the cruel Russian autocrat. I watched as Tucker Carlson and J.D. Vance defended Putin, or adopted the Kremlin\u2019s critique of Ukraine. The country was a \u201cpure client state of the United States State Department\u201d said Carlson. \u201cSpare me the performative affection for the Ukraine\u201d said Vance on Steve Bannon\u2019s War Room podcast.\n\nThese interventions, made as Russia began an invasion that looks set to result in the deaths of thousands of Ukrainian civilians, look high risk and low reward. These commentators are undermining the credibility they have accrued for taking bold stances on the \u201csecurity and identity\u201d issues their base really cares about. Namely: wokeness, the border, crime and defending national heritage. \u2026\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re going to dig in on this.\n",
