To dust.\u201d\n\nMad Vlad's mouthpiece, his face twisted with rage, then switches to English and begins shouting: \u201cBurn in hell!\u201d and \u201cFlames!\u201d\n\nSolovyov was responding to a panellist who made a wildly exaggerated claim about a news story published by The Sun.\n\nREAD MORE ON THE SUN\n\nHe fumed: \u201cThe British press is saying \u2018We\u2019ll give them hell! I\u2019m quoting verbatim from their most popular paper The Sun.\n\n\u201cThey all regard this as completely fine - \u2018Russians can and need to be killed\u2019. They\u2019re saying that constantly.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one problem with Russians. They won\u2019t give up as easily as that.\u201d\n\nThe clip and its translation was tweeted by BBC Monitoring, which regularly posts on pro-Kremlin propaganda shows.\n\nMost read in The Sun\n\nIt comes after Volodymyr Zelensky asked for 600mph British missiles when he visited the UK recently with a shopping list of weapons.\n\nUkrainian defence sources Kyiv would be prepared to use the missiles to strike Crimea\n\nIt followed a warning from Zelensky that longer-range weapons from western allies would allow Ukraine to take the battle to areas occupied by Russian.\n\n\"It will allow us to make the evil completely retreat from our country by destroying its airbases deep in the occupied territories,\u201d he said during his visit.\n\nIn response, Rishi Sunak said \u201cnothing is off the table\u201d when it comes to military support for Ukraine.\n\nThe Government is still weighing up whether to send deadly Harpoon anti-ship missiles or surface-to-air Storm Shadows to arm Ukrainian defenders.\n\nAfter Germany finally agree to send tanks, Solovyov, and other Kremlin propagandists threatened nuclear strikes on the West.\n\nIn a similar rant he claimed it meant Germany had joined the war.\n\nSolovyov said: \"It\u2019s time to send a clear, resolute message that we now consider Germany a direct party to the conflict, rekindling memories of World War Two.\n\n\u201cGerman tanks appearing [in Ukraine] will definitely mean we consider German territory, military bases and other sites as legitimate targets.\u201d\n\nRaging Moscow TV pundit Yevgeny Satanovsky said warheads should be launched on the German capital Berlin and the country\u2019s parliament, the Bundestag.\n\n\u201cFlat, slightly radioactive, melted-down ground [will remain in its place].\u201d\n\nUkrainian defenders are bracing for an assault that could include 1,800 tanks, 3,950 armoured vehicles, 400 fighter jets and 300 helicopters incoming from Russia.\n\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\n\nHowever, NATO\u2019s Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, has said that Russia has already launched its new offensive and was \u201csending more troops, more weapons, more capabilities\u201d.\n\nUkraine has been monitoring the military build-up as they continue to plea for Western support.",
