Together we can ensure our platform remains a hub for empowering ideas committed to fighting for a sustainable, healthy, and compassionate world. Please support us in keeping our mission strong.\n\nTwo climate activists disrupted the National Archives rotunda and galleries in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday afternoon. The perpetrators, identified as Donald Zepeda, 35, and Jackson Green, 27, both residents of Washington, D.C., dumped red powder on the case housing the U.S. Constitution, prompting an early closure of the premises to the public.\n\n\nThe National Archives, in a press release, reassured the public that the encasement shielded the Constitution from any harm. However, conservators are assessing the extent of the damage caused to the rotunda. The suspects were promptly apprehended and escorted out by security personnel.\n\nThe motive behind the act appears to be linked to climate change activism. A video circulating on social media captured the moment when the two men, drenched in red powder, delivered prepared speeches regarding Climate change while standing before the Constitution\u2019s protective case.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to foment a rebellion,\u201d declared one of the men in the video. \u201cWe all deserve clean air, water, food, and a livable climate.\u201d The group Declare Emergency, a Climate change activism organization, confirmed to NBC Washington that the detained individuals were indeed members of their movement.\n\nColleen Shogan, the Archivist of the United States, expressed deep concern over the violation of the sanctity of the National Archives Rotunda, emphasizing its significance as the repository of the nation\u2019s founding documents.\n\n\u201cThe National Archives Rotunda is the sanctuary for our nation\u2019s founding documents. They are here for all Americans to view and understand the principles of our nation,\u201d Shogan stated. \u201cWe take such vandalism very seriously and we will insist that the perpetrators be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d\n\nAs a consequence of the disruption, the National Archives Rotunda will remain closed for cleaning on Thursday, while the rest of the building will continue to operate on its regular schedule.\n\nWake Up Climate Change Is Real by Tiny Rescue: Climate Collection\n\nRelated Content:\n\n- Shell vs. Greenpeace: A Legal Battle Over Climate Protests\n\n- New Climate Protests in New York Signal Rising Pressure on Global Leaders\n\n- Just Stop Oil Climate Protesters Disrupt World Snooker Championship\n\n- Climate Protestors Block London Bridge\n\n- 21 Climate Change Protestors Arrested Outside President Biden\u2019s Campaign Office\n\nEasy Ways to Help the Planet:\n\n- Eat Less Meat: Download Food Monster, the largest plant-based Recipe app on the App Store, to help reduce your environmental footprint, save animals and get healthy.
