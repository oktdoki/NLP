It's horrible.\"\n\nUsyk was much more guarded on the stage where he and Joshua bumped fists for the first time in almost a year.\n\nHiding his ice-cold glare from everyone bar AJ under his bucket hat, the southpaw sensation did almost nothing to help sell the fight and everything to frighten his old foe.\n\nHe said: \u201cI never make loud or bright speeches, I just work hard in my gym and training camp.\n\n\"That\u2019s what I am going to do until the fight.\n\n\u201cAnd then I will enter the ring and make you happy with my boxing.\u201d\n\n\ud83e\udd4a AJ vs Usyk 2 date, live stream and TV channel for blockbuster rematch",
